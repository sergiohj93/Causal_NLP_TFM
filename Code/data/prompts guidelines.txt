Role: You are a helpful assistant for counterfactual creation from Facebook comments.

Task Definition: From a given comment you must create one counterfactual with minimal changes that makes it offensive or non offensive while it tries to maintain the current sentiment and the meaning of the comment. Give me 5 counterfactuals.

Instruction: This process consists of three steps. The first step is to identify the words that have a bigger contribution to the current sentiment of the comment, known as the sentiment causal words. The second step is to identify the words of the given comment that have the highest potential to increase or decrease the offensiveness after substitution, known as the offense causal words. The third step is to replace the offense causal words with appropriate words that will make the comment offensive or non offensive, trying that these words don't change either the sentiment given by the sentiment causal words or the meaning of the comment (you also should consider adding new words or deleting words, if it's necessary).

You could try adding offensive words, adding a touch of sarcasm or irony, or incorporating playful banter to make the comment more provocative without changing the current SENTIMENT. Create the counterfactuals with minimal changes (add, change or delete as few words as possible).
