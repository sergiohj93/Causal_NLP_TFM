"THIS IS THE ONLY BIBLE PROPHECY LEFT TO BE FULFILLED. AND I SINCERELY WISH THAT IT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS. FOR THOSE WHO SAY TO ""BELIEVE"" ONLY IN JESUS' OWN WORDS, THESE ARE HIS. MATHEW 24:1-51 ""Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.‚Äù Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, ‚ÄúTell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?‚Äù And Jesus answered and said to them: ‚ÄúTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, ‚ÄòI am the Christ,‚Äô and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. ‚ÄúThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name‚Äôs sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. ‚ÄúTherefore when you see the ‚Äòabomination of desolation,‚Äô spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place‚Äù (whoever reads, let him understand), ‚Äúthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect‚Äôs sake those days will be shortened. ‚ÄúThen if anyone says to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Christ!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere!‚Äô do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. ‚ÄúTherefore if they say to you, ‚ÄòLook, He is in the desert!‚Äô do not go out; or ‚ÄòLook, He is in the inner rooms!‚Äô do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together. ‚ÄúImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. ‚ÄúNow learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near‚Äîat the doors! Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. ‚ÄúBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. ‚ÄúWho then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods. But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‚ÄòMy master is delaying his coming,‚Äô and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."""	0

As a current serving member with over 21yrs service in the infantry and as a firefighter, I have served with and currently serve with women and transgender. I was an instructor at the infantry Battleschool and I instructed/evaluated, and passed very fit and competent women. I have worked for a female Platoon commander that was one of the best officers I've worked for. I have served alongside women on multiple deployments to Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. In the fire trade I am currently an instructor with plenty of female recruits. We also have transgender firefighters at some of our firehalls. There has never been a time that their abilities, dedication, sacrifice, motivation, fitness, has ever come into question. Too many men still feel insecure. They somehow try to use the excuse.... it's a distraction, they can't meet the same physical standards, etc. There's so much ignorance going around. It blows my mind.	0

"The majority of women in developed countries don't serve and ""aren't about that life""? That's news to me! Former Army nurse here, (ex) wife, daughter, sister and granddaughter of Army soldiers. I am not a liberal and strongly disagree with this. Trump has never served, therefore you are contradicting yourself when you state that anyone who hasn't served should decide this or knows what they're talking about if they disagree. If you're this concerned about someone else's sexuality, I don't think that you should serve either. You give us a bad name. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_military_by_country"	0

I think you might want to re-read the Gospels and study St. Paul. Please pay special attention to 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. There's a plethora of sins listed, not just homosexuality, and the end is most important in that all people are capable of redemption and salvation. Calling people names, comparing them to animals, etc. is no way to evangelize and most certainly does not reflect how Jesus Christ treated people. In fact, it's a poor representation of the truth in Jesus Christ. A disciple of Jesus Christ should speak the truth with gentleness and respect. See 1 Peter 3:15. Speak the truth in Jesus Christ.	0

"get off your high horse and stop waving the Constitution around when you have only situational respect for it. What about the life and liberty of our Citizens that have been murdered, raped and destroyed by alien Criminals under deportation orders but released by Sanctuary pukes onto our streets? Want to start a list of those? And that ""woman with a brain tumor"" had an immigration hearing in January and was denied asylum. That's due process but I'm guessing the only due process you'll acknowledge must achieve your desired result. And all the Trump Admin. did was revoke the ""guidance"". That guidance did not disappear from the record and Schools can follow any policy they decide such as ...allowing students to choose which bathroom they use. You whining Leftist's want the Federal Government to be your hammer against States rights when it fits you but become ardent Federalists when sanctuary is challenged. I'm so glad Trump is defeating you at every turn."	1

"These comments underlie the long term feud between leftists and people with right-wing views over opinion whether transsexualism is a mental disorder or not. This is a similar dicussion like the issue of abortion where some consider it murder while others a medical treatment. I think this is an insoluble problem which always triggering fierce dispute. Although I don't consider transgenders less capable of fighting and having weaker fortitude than others, I think that enlisting them to army would entail more mundane problems like bathrooms, toilets and so on but if any army wanted to accept them, it would tackle this small problem for sure. The problem is whether people with ""mental disorder"" should be conscripted into army or not. A man without legs wouldn't be accepted by army (although I am not sure) but it is visible disorder while transgenderism is a disputable subject."	1

I agree with Guiliano on that one - it's a very irrational fear to have that the human race is going to die out any time soon because of homosexuals.

"judge not lest you be judged and found wanting. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye whilst ignoring the log in your own etc etc. You cannot claim to be religious when you are judgemental, clearly do not love thy neighbour as thyself and you doubtless go against a whole host of other Christian values. Why is it that the people who do not claim to be religious can actually be more godly and ""Christian"" in their attitudes and behaviour than some of those that do? In my experience the so called religious people that I have met have shown themselves to be right nasty pieces of work when it suited them. Give me an atheist any day!"	0

"So, to take your points in turn: 1) There was a study performed by RAND Corp. in 2016 to determine the effects of having transgender people in the military, and the cost was determined to be negligible. So, ultimately, ""cutting corners"" is not really all that necessary in this situation. 2) That study also examined several other military forces around the world that have transgender people enlisted and found no significant instances of loss of unit cohesion or morale. 3) That same study again noted that the number of transgender people serving between 1320 and 6630. It's tough to get an accurate number because it's not something the DoD really tracks, but some estimates put it above 10,000. That's not proven, though. At any rate, I think the important thing is that for people serving in the military, beyond gender, beyond race, beyond background, beyond sexuality, you are first a soldier. It's one of the first things you learn there. As long as leadership is in place, then any gender, sexuality, or gender identity can serve alongside each other. No, it's not going to be perfect, and yes, there will probably be incidents, but I applaud these folks for their voluntary service. I certainly didn't have the fortitude. Here's the study, if you're interested: https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/06/30.html"	0

1) fully transitioned trans people would be barracked according to who they are. Simple. Army policy for transition - I don't know. 2) If you're a man, you follow the mens requirements, and vice versa. Being trans is no different. 3) Actually, statistically speaking, trans women more often turn out to date women. I guess once you've crossed the gender divide, other divides are almost meaningless. Trans people also tend to date other trans people, presumably because they understand each other's experience more than non-trans people. ... and if a trans woman thought you looked attractive, take it as a compliment mate, just as you would from any woman. It doesn't mean that they're itching to jump down your kegs any more than any other woman is... or, for that matter, any gay guy that might be in the bed next to you.

I can't say there's a definitive reason as to why there are such problems amongst transgenders and neither can you since there is no conclusive evidence, only hypothesis and theory but there is a big belief in psychologists that it's not due to their treatment in society but more due to the feeling of gender dysphoria not being treated as a problem but being celebrated so they never get the therapy they need but instead just go through with gender altering operations before analysing properly their mental health before hand which only worsens the problem. The truth is we don't know why there are such problems within the transgender community but we can't risk the security of a country because of these problems until we conduct more research and find the real reasons, only then should we allow them to serve the military, when we know more	1

*shrug* the decision to allow openly transgender poisons persons to serve was taken with the support of the Pentagon. There are thousands of transgender persons in active service now and I expect many or most of them were happy with the Obama-era policy change. Politicians and career military officers have also gone on the record supporting the military's first steps into the modern world. So even a cursory analysis shows that your claim that allowing openly transgender persons to serve in the military is only applauded by those who haven't themselves served... is flat out wrong. Do you enjoy being so completely wrong?	0

I think that you'll find that any transgender people in your squadron won't want to be treated like 'spacial snowflakes' if that's what you mean. You'll more likely find that they just want to be treated like any part of the team. You on the other hand snowflake, seem to want to be in a special squadron that does not represent the population in which you live! Its probably not the best career move to try and dictate to the RAF what they should do, just accept it or don't join. Just remember that if you are lucky enough to be accepted and then get sent to a conflict zone, the chances are that you will be fighting for people's freedom (what you would want to deny of others in your squadron). Oh, and if you are too sensitive / not brave enough to be in a squadron or accommodation with people from a different background or outlook, war may not be for you snowflake.	1

Mulya, you seem to have skill with English and at least know how to debate with it, so writing things like 'HANG EM GAYS' is really weakening your position.

Watching him and his goons trying to deliver one of his major projects and seeing them fail on most of their promised outcomes and having had the misfortune of hearing him ramble on about a subject that I do know far more about than he does I feel completely vindicated in calling him a dickhead because quite frankly if Clinton / Bush (x2) / Obama were bad he is on a whole different level of incompetence"	1

I will say this, if you believe in God stop pretending you are one. Stop judging people and dictating what they should do. God could have made everyone follow his way but he didn't, he gave us free will and we deal with the consequences of our decision. There have been so many murders in the name of Christianity, you defend a religion not God. Your ignorance to human suffering is sickening.	0
Omg, what a load of deflection. So we leave it up to states, many of which have not shown any particular respect for any form of human rights, from civil rights to voting rights, to dismantle transgender rights. Brilliant. It has always been necessary for human rights to be defended at the federal level, due to the regressiveness of some of our more ass-backwards states. Nice try tho. :/	1

im not saying people have to do or cant do anything, im saying that a worry is that turning marriage into something that is purely about two adults can have bad effects. it seems like it could have went down 1 of 2 routes to me. !. marriage is serious and is for all to do, but you have to take the responsibility of taking it serious and not just breaking up and not try to hold it together. to keep the idea that marriage is a lasting bond/contract 2. marriage is no big deal, let anyone do what they want with it and effect how its seen socially. personally i like route 1, as route 2 can have victims in the from of kids with single parents	1

Homosexuality is a moral aberration. For every species, God created male & female.The western world has succeeded in importing this filthy culture to more conservative parts of the world where such practices were rare and unknown.

As a woman, I am uncomfortable with a man using the same bathroom as myself. I respect all human beings and how they view themselves but I firmly believe that whatever gender you were born is what you are for the rest of your life no matter what.

I respect everybody's alternative lifestyle's but when I'm using a public bathroom, as a woman I want to know that only women are in there.	1

Hi Paul! This is really misguided. let's use an example to educate you. For instance, has every straight woman that you've ever interacted with been unable to concentrate on the task at hand because she's so distracted by your sex appeal? I'm guessing the answer is probably no. The same applies to gay men. Not all of them will be attracted to you. Likely, most of them won't because you comment stuff like this. Thanks!!	0

This isn't about sexuality, it's about gender! A trans man is a man. A trans woman is a woman. Trump is saying any person who has chosen to change their gender, e.i. change from make to female or female to male cannot serve in the US military. There is no reason why this should be the case.	0

Those who served in the military are a very small percentage of the population also. When you see coverage of a soldier serving in the mid-east (an even smaller percentage of the population) do you feel that the media coverage has gone too far? Are those men and women risking their lives being shoved down your throat?	0
Keith Pflepsen As it stands with the repeal, Caitlyn and other trans people will have to use the bathroom associated with their birth sex rather than what they identify with. So, using Caitlyn as an example, she would not be allowed to use the women's restroom and instead would have to use the men's. This is probably going to be a state by state issue and many states will continue to have equal bathroom rights, but many others have been waiting for this.	0

As a former solder. I have a few questions. Do transgender recruits get their own rooms separate from male & females or do the men have to share with someone born a female or women share with someone born a man? Do transgender also benefit from the different minimum requirements for men & women to be a soldier? As its easier for a woman to be a solder & pass all tests than it is a man, because women get longer to run the 3 1/2 mile run & so forth. So does a man now a woman, fall under female rules or keep the male rules? Finally, If I was sharing barracks or whatever with a transgender female that was born a man. Who will most likely be attracted to men. I would feel uncomfortable being around such a person & be offended if such interest was gazed upon myself.	1

A strict 50%/50% policy would not be inclusive - people don't walk into recruitment centres in pairs of one male, one female. It fluctuates and to impose a rule that says you can only recruit a man if you also recruit a woman means more people would have to be turned away than could be accepted. Inclusion is about accepting people in, not turning people away because they don't balance a policy.	0
"As a proud & dedicated Straight Ally, I hope to attend Pride in London one year, as well as those of Blackpool, Brighton & Manchester. Last week's Cumbria Pride in Carlisle was a resounding success and I composed the following poem, which I was honoured to perform on stage. I like to think that the words capture nicely the essence as to the need for Pride events. WHY PRIDE? To celebrate diversity, love and tolerance To champion dignity, respect and above all else, acceptance. To educate against prejudice, ignorance and bigotry. To maintain the fight until these ills are banished to history. To reflect on battles won in the name of LGBT rights. To remember that more needs to be done. in order to scale further heights. So next time someone asks ""Why Pride?"" Look them square in the eye. Then reel off all those reasons before saying with pride ""THAT'S WHY""."	0

"Guess what? People whose gender doesn't align with their sex have always fought for the US military. Just like homosexuals have always fought for the US military.

You don't want your beliefs exposed as the immoral, empty beliefs they are."	1
My father tried enlisting during the Vietnam era. You know what? He had a common skin condition and the USA military REJECTED him. If they can reject someone with psoriasis then they can reject a transgender which is a mental disorder. The military is not a social experiment for this crap. I support Trump in this decision. GOOD. Btw, almost every man in my family on both sides have served in our American military.	1

"Ah, but there's a difference between doing ""what's best"", and doing something for political points. Did you know that this all started with the US House of Representatives arguing about whether Dept. of Defense funds should be used for gender reassignment surgery for transgender soldiers? Because it might have led to a bill failing, something Trump didn't want to keep happening, House Republicans turned to him to address the idea of such funding. So he said he was banning transgender people entirely. Not just the surgery. Not just those looking to seek surgery. The entire transgender population of the US military, which number in the thousands. Now I agree there's a hardy debate to be had about whether or not to use funds for such surgery, but the idea of using that as an opportunity to completely ban a group of people from serving is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There are transgender people right now serving in the US military not seeking surgery, nor taking regular hormone treatments. There are also people who have completed transitioning that don't need regular treatments. So these are able people that are being denied their privilege to serve their country, when it has been proven via a study performed by RAND Corp in 2016 that not only is the monetary burden negligible, but also proved through referencing other countries that openly have transgender people serving (like the UK) that there is no effect on morale or unit cohesion. I agree there are times to be doing things for the best even if some people don't like it (such as marriage equality being passed in the US two years ago), but you have to still do the work and learn whether it really is for the best, or if it's only to look good for certain people."	0

Definition of mental illness any of a broad range of medical conditions (such as major depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, or panic disorder) that are marked primarily by sufficient disorganization of personality, mind, or emotions to impair normal psychological functioning and cause marked distress or disability and that are typically associated with a disruption in normal thinking, feeling, mood, behavior, interpersonal interactions, or daily functioning ..... So if you think that a different sexual orientation to the majority is a disruption in normal thinking, then maybe by your definition you are correct. Since we are all different, maybe we are all mentally ill?	0

Jesse, conveniently, you left out Jesus Christ and His teachings, like most. Just because there are people who do bad things in the name of Christianity because they are misguided or part of a cult that is falsely called Christianity, does not mean every single one is like that. You're generalizing and using extreme examples instead of recognizing the good people who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. When groups of atheists protest, riot and destroy property, I do not say all atheists are violent, despicable people as a whole. The OP left Jesus Christ out of his posts as well. I addressed this before. He's incorrect by doing so. He's just name calling and insulting people because it's the only way he can feel superior in his world. It's easy to point fingers at others while failing to pluck the log out of your own eye. Many struggle with this, including myself. However, leaving out Jesus Christ and His teachings is not really speaking about Christianity.	0

For those condemning homosexuality and anything associated with it the facts may surprise many. Sexuality is determined in the womb of the mother of the unborn child. Hormonal differences which the mother has no control over determine your sexual orientation. The unborn child has no say whatsoever. This is a well researched medical fact. The Russians during the Communist era manipulated the hormones of mothers to determine the sexuality of the child. They were very able to determine the sexuality of children with a 100% success rate. So For the morons those are the facts. Children have no say in their sexuality. It is determined by nature.	0

So if people you know, say colleagues, asked if you were married Sean, would you tell them to mind their own business or would you answer? Because it seems odd that someone would tell their colleagues to mind their own business. So if we assume that most people would answer that question, where does that leave gay and bisexual people who might be in a same-sex marriage? They have to come out at that point because it will be assumed they are heterosexual, as that is the assumption in our society. So it's not about telling everyone about your private life. It's about being able to talk about your life in the same way that heterosexual people can.	0

so, he has an opinion. You would prefer that he doesn't express it. I disagree with people all the time. People disagree with me. What's wrong with that? The problem with people on the left of the political spectrum is that they. try to stifle debate by branding people who hold or express views contrary to the ones , they hold as bigots,homophobes, racists etc, they espouse free speech and are then outraged if someone like Folau, who is a Christian, eloquently expresses his views about being against same sex marriage. So what is your point ? Are you saying he should shut up. . Should everyone in the upcoming referendum in Australia vote yes for gay marriage in case they offend lesbians and gays?	0

"You base your entire life around a book full of talking animals, unicorns, and magic lol. You have ZERO right to talk about what's ""natural"" or ""moral"" when you're a part of a religion that to this day oppresses, rapes, lynches, tortures, and murders hundreds of thousands- particularly in Africa where innocent people accused of being ""witches"" are barbarically burnt alive while the murderers praise their god all the while and lesbian women are violently gang-raped. Your religion is barbaric and depraved and you worship a blood-thirsty god that slaughtered a group of children simply for making fun of a prophet's bald head. There's not an iota of ""love"" or ""compassion"" in your religous extremism and the fact that the majority of the poor, violent, most oppressive 3rd-world countries are all highly religious (Africa, the Middle East, etc.) while the richest, safest, happiest, healthiest countries with the most human rights are all highly secular (USA, the majority of Europe) attest to the how damaging religious mania can be. You can stick to being a slave to a hateful, oppressive, and murderous deity, but for those of us fortunate enough to live in a free country, we'll continue believing in whatever the hell we want, loving who we want, and living our lives as WE- not you or your Bronze Age death cult- see fit. It's not surprising that a Christianist wouldn't understand the basic concept behind consent- that being that rape, murdee, and molestation- things that the religious practice in much higher numbers than any atheist or agnostic- are in no way comparable to a consenting couple of the same sex loving each other. You people don't understand consent because everything your bible stands for lies in direct contradiction to freedom and with that, consent. That's why your bible approves of slavery, theocracy, and forcing rape victims to marry their rapists, because it is built upon a disgusting, violent, and regressive idealogy that encourages its followers to be sociopathic monsters that attack, oppress, enslave, and murder, all under the mantle of Christian ""love"". Your country is in a bad enough state- what with the constant lynchings, entire villages bludgeoning and burning innocent people- including defenseless children and the developmentally disabled- to death for perceived slights, rampant rape, extreme poverty, disease, famine, religious extremism, and corrupt government- without you people being concerned with what other people are doing in the privacy of their bedrooms or what's between their legs. If religionists focused on their OWN lives and on making this world a safer, better, more loving place to live instead of filling their own pockets, spreading hatred and encouraging violence against anyone who dare live outside their regressive idealogy, and playing false prophets and miracle worker to fool the ignorant masses, they might be able to begin making a positive impact, but since that's never going to happen, your mantle of ""love and compassion"" is a false one.

...the medical welfare of armed forces personnel comes under the armed forces budget and not the NHS. Hence at times you can get private treatment and sometimes you get NHS.

And that is why people who have eczema get turned away....because they need simple creams to help them stave off a very simple condition on civi Street.

Gerard - that is an opinion you hold; not a fact. It has been that way for many years, and I believe that for many years society has been morally wrong. Marriage can exist between two people of the same gender, no problem at all. That's because love is something up here, not down there.	0

"Well, there's quite a lot to answer there! I'll ignore the global warming red herring at the end (nice try, though, petal). 1. Genetically, there are 2 SEXES, not genders. ""Sex"" refers to biological differences (hormones, genitalia etc), whereas gender refers to sociocultural norms associated with sex. (See WHO's website for details; see also Pavlov 2014). Conflating sex and gender really is a schoolboy error (or is that expression not considered PC enough?) 2. The science isn't settled that being transgender is a mental disease. You're either deliberately misinterpreting the facts or have misunderstood them. 3. Johns Hopkins has recently reopened its gender clinic, and now performs gender reassignment treatments after re-evaluating McHugh's findings. 4. Citing McHugh alone ignores the scores of other psychiatrists whose findings differ greatly from those presented by McHugh (for example Colizzi et al, De Cuypere et al., and so on). 5. The methodology in Hopkins research was criticised for being flawed almost immediately after its publication. It judged patients to be ""poorly adjusted"" if they were involved in relationships with someone of the same sex post-transition. 6. Thepublicdiscourse is run by a far-right think-tank, and can thus be discredited due to ideological interference. Present a more neutral source and you might have an argument. 7. McHugh's findings can also be discredited based on ideological conflict; in 1992, he admitted that his goal was to have the gender clinic at Johns Hopkins shut down after taking it over in 1975, 4 years before his ""findings"" were made public. Isn't that a swell coincidence? (See McHugh, 1992). 8. Gender dysphoria (arguably an offshoot of ego-dystonic sexual identity disorder) certainly exists, but not everyone who is trans suffers from it. 9. You don't ""enable"" a mental disorder. They occur. Reassignment therapy can be seen as a form of treatment for those who suffer from gender dysphoria. 10. I actually agree that children should not undergo reassignment therapy, for the simple reason that their development has not finished, and thus it's possible that they may change as they advance through their teenage years. 11. Hopkins is but one hospital. Their policy is not representative of other hospitals where reassignment therapy has proven to be a success over a prolonged period. 12. You cite McHugh yet do not provide the name or coauthors of his work, nor do you explain the methodology. You're simply regurgitating the information that you found on a far right website. 13. Johns Hopkins were quick to distance themselves from McHugh, contending that his research doesn't represent their views. I'm sure that your life would be more fulfilling if you didn't waste it trying to make others miserable, babe. Oh, and ""liberal"" isn't really an insult, given that it means ""free"", although it speaks volumes about your own ideology and outlook. You take care now xoxoxo"	0

The people supporting trans in the military have never served in the military or even has the intention of joining. The military/war in general is a brutal place. Not every career or occupation in this world is meant for everyone. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Like me, I was an infantryman that does not want women in those type of units. I'm all for women being aircraft pilots, submarine commanders, battleship commanders, but certain jobs are not meant for everyone. That goes for transgenders. We always have to be ready to fight and win conflicts, be at our peak without jeopardizing standards. Those who have never served should probably not comment on what they know nothing about. The military isn't a social experiment, it's a place where we train to slaughter our enemies and create warriors.	1

However, I think we should embrace those people who bought into his con, and are now recognizing that they were duped. I will not fault or chastise anyone who wants to change their mind or reevaluate their prior support of Trump. I can only hope that as each dangerous and damaging policy begins to personally touch those who thought he was their champion, they will finally understand how scary he is, how scary he has been to most of us all along, and join the fight to take him down - or at the very least not vote for him a second time.

I have not cherry picked anything. I explained to you that if you're discussing Christianity, you cannot leave out the teachings of Jesus Christ. Pretty simple üòâ. Let's start with stoning people in the Old Covenant. When Jesus Christ came, He said let he without sin cast the first stone. That is the New Covenant. Jesus Christ fulfilled God's Commandment of thou shalt not kill. He became the sacrificial lamb and died for everyone's sin. Jesus Christ reversed Moses' law on divorce and fulfilled God's Commandment of thou shalt not commit adultery. Again, the Old Covenant leads to the New Covenant. Jesus Christ did not come to change God's law. He came to fulfill God's Commandments. Jesus Christ condensed the Commandments into two: Love God with all your heart and love one another as He loved us. That's Christianity. Again, when you leave out Jesus Christ, you are leaving out the truth.	0

HI Tom. In America they have a president. he is Donald Trump. And its in America that the article is about. Notice you are based in Leeds which is in the UK where the rules and laws are different.

Mike just leave them alone, immediately after Trump's removal, USA will vote for a female president, then some thing very painful will happen in USA which i am not willing to share with you here but for you, repent and be baptised in Jesus' name for the remission of your sins, water baptism is by imersion/not by sprinkling and neither done on infants, then pray for the holy spirit i.e be born of water and spirit if you are to exape God's wrath that will very soon after Trumpt's regime fall on your land. Also remember God blessed USA and gave her a prophet called William Marion Branham with a message to forerun Jesus' second coming and America turned down the word of God. Rapture is at hand brother! the saints are about to leave this world! don't delay your correct and scriptural water baptism and claim the holy spirit because Jesus who promised this is faithful and true. Don't delay brother and don't worry, you will still see a worse USA than you are seeing now, send me a friend request and i tell you more	0

I'm all for gay marriage. But it isn't a human right. It's a civil right (very different). It's a contract with the government and the people who sign it, nothing else. It's supid because it gives you many restrictions, responsibilities and potential legal issues. Really not worth it. Many of the benefits from marriage can be tricked somehow. The thing is that many other contracts with the government depend on that one. I really think that the governments really don't care much about gay marriage but the task of restructuring social contracts and procedures. I understand that the movement is symbolic. But as a heterosexual guy, marriage doesn't interest me much.	0

I served in the British Army for almost 25 years. I did multiple operational tours. During these tours I did, on occasion, serve with soldiers who later (when it was legalised) came out as gay. Some of them I knew were gay, some I suspected, some I had no idea. Did it bother me - not one iota. To a man and woman they were professional, tough, reliable and resilient. Not once was I propositioned or had inappropriate advances made towards me. Those sort of things only happen in the prurient minds of those who have never been in this situation. I suggest you do some growing up, some research, and get out a bit!	0

"I absolutely love logical fallacies. First, educate yourself about the subjectivity of morals and ethics in so far that every culture creates, maintains, and reinforces them differently. Merely 100 years ago, someone of your ethnic origin would not be entitled to state your opinion based on ""moral grounds""... obviously and rightfully this moral landscape has since been abolished. Wouldn't you agree? Then wouldn't it be possible that your current moral compass is misaligned? Second, whose God are you referring - surely you're not qualified to speak upon his/her behalf? Please do not hide behind religion - be straight forward and state these as your opinions. This way it's much easier to attack you instead of looking like a atheist. Nothing against God, just you. Third, assuming you are capable of intelligence, like we all are, then have you ever once tried to take a pragmatic approach to your beliefs (aka consider its practical implication)? Or are you just regurgitating the content you were force fed? Seriously, sit down and think: if homosexuals are really destined for hell anyways, what's the point in wasting your time on a Facebook comment section? Are you contributing to the ultimate good?Can't you just go about your day and revel in the fact that you're living the righteous life? Fourth, filth?! Surely you have the capacity to have developed a vocabulary far more extensive than this. Fifth, truth...? Your opinion is more appropriate. There are are currently +7 billion of them on this planet. What are the chances yours is the right one? Last, those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Pious facades are such an unappealing trait."	0

Dorrence, get with the 21st century. The times, they are a changing!	0
you should direct your question to a shrink, for they are the doctors that follow the path of a transgeder and try to access their deepest insight. To my humble opionion, and I'm no doctor here, if your only memories about your sexuality and body are those of discomfort, probably it means that you don't really fit in the body you are born with. Gender figure also plays a great deal in this, what other people in you society expect your gender to be like, to behave like. That's where shrinks come in, digging their way through their mind and emotions and trying to figure it all out. The undeniable truth is that it is a long and painful and difficult path, no one decides to be a transgender overnight or just because he fancies high heels nad beads. Another truth is that transgenders are taxpayers too, just like everyone else, they work and study, they graduate and contribute to the country wellness just like everyone else, I don't see why they shouldn't access to the medical care they need just like everyone else.	0

The cost of Transgender health care is extremely minimal in comparison to the healthcare budget. This is not an issue of cost it is the fact that they have singled out an already oppressed group in society. The 15,000 trans people who serve the military do it out of pride for their country not to build up healthcare costs. Now they have lost their livelihoods and all respect for serving in the military. You must not think of only cost but the actual effect on human beings whose job is to protect and to serve their country and the civilians that live in it.	0

That's right. God's holding these peoples' souls over the burning pit of hell. Their flesh and their souls will rot forever, and they will suffer endless torment if they don't repent and learn that God loves them. Their nature is not their nature. Man's only nature is to fear God and live in God's good graces and mercy, hoping for their deliverance from their sinful ways through repentance and God's endless love. Otherwise, they will get the eternal torture that they deserve. Because God loves them. It all makes sense.	1

Paul, you cannot prove God does not exist. Just like we cannot prove there is no life outside of our solar system. That doesn't make it an unwarranted theory until it is proven wrong. Steven Hawkins believes there are other beings in the universe. Does that make him delusional and ignorant? Obviously not. You have a choice to believe or not to. Many people believe in some sort of higher power. Just because we cannot touch it or see it doesn't make it any less true or plausible. It's a great mystery that will be revealed. Personally, I know there is something greater than me because I feel His presence. You cannot prove my experiences wrong either. You cannot prove Steven Hawkins is wrong.	0

The people of Lot lived in a society very similar to our own. It was corrupt, the people had no shame, criminals and criminal activity abounded, and those passing through the town of Sodom risked robbery and physical abuse. The overall atmosphere of the town was not one of a cohesive society. The people of Lot were without morals, without standards and without shame. The homosexuality that abounded did not exist in a vacuum, it was part of a lifestyle that not only allowed, but also encouraged vice and corruption. It was to this town that God sent Prophet Lot; his message was to worship God alone. However, embedded in worship are the desire and the willingness to obey God‚Äôs commandments? The people of Sodom were content with their corrupt ways and had no desire to curb them. Lot became an annoyance and his words were ignored.	1

"Thanks too. This is the seventh & last church age with its messanger(prophet) called William Marion Branham, a USA born, with the spirit of Eligha of Malachi chapter 4. This is end time. By the way it is THUS SAITH THE LORD: USA will lie in total ruins when the Lord will very soon deliver her in the hand of her enemies, but when that happens in your time brother, have no hope because the bride will have already left the earth, what follows immediately is a worldwide tribulation (plauges, suffering and persecution) and the only hope left will be the white throne judgement after the millenium reign of Jesus Christ when all shall be judged by him, BUT WHO CAN STAND GOD'S JUDGEMENT WHEN HE APPEARS? So look out for ""end time message pastors"" in your community to lead you to Jesus Christ by the word/ not by creed, denomination, theological college, organisation, but by the word. God is in his word, repent & be baptised in Jesus Christ's name and all your sins shall be remitted, it is by imersion not sprinkling."	0

You don't live in your bedroom. You live in a world of friends,family colleagues and strangers. Coming out isn't about sex, it's about being yourself. My relationship with my husband isn't restricted to our bedroom. We go out for dinner, see friends, work, and our relationship is the centre of our lives. Why can't gay people have that. Coming out shouldn't be necessary, but sure as hell they shouldn't be forced to hide in a bedroom	0

All are entitled to their own opinion and this is mine: unless you are (or have) served your country in the military then your opinion has less validity. Also, feel free to exit your comfortable life if you have not served and replace the trans person you want removed from service...and maybe we could also exit the blacks, gays, Jews, Catholics as we are all pedophiles, maybe Mexicans and Muslims and more. I suggest the bunch of you who will not be enlisting to make LOTS of babies, or offer up your existing kids, as they can step up to the plate in replacement for those who have chosen to serve that you would exit from service.	0

Don't be so ignorant. A gay man knows he is gay from a very early age. As does a lesbian. The majority of these people are unsure of their sexuality until very late in their lives (comparatively) In a war situation, I certainly wouldn't want someone with self doubts covering my back. 99.99% of people know they are straight, gay or lesbian. Why should they have to make allowances for the 00.01% who demand special treatment? Get real	1

Hi Roy hope you are ok, Trans people are not gay. also the only thing thats being rammed down your throat is information about inequality, prejudice and the lack or recognition that 15,000 american trans soldiers have made a pledge that if needs be, they will sacrifice their life for the sake of others. Anyone who is able to join military services to support their country shouldn't be persecuted with such venom. Maybe more appreciation, more tolerance and acceptance and then less wars.	0

"According to people who agree with you, God doesn't like gays because they are sinning - but we all sin. We all sin every day, God forgives sins. He can't not love a minority because he is Benevolent. Think before you write, all of you who say God doesn't love homosexuality are hypocrites and whatever religious evidence you try to use can easily be contradicted by other religious beliefs within the same religion. In the Catholic faith and many other denominations it's not even ""outlawed by God"" to be homosexual, it's ""wrong"" to have homosexual sex. Anyway I believe that we all deserve to love and be loved and I was so happy to be at the Pride Parade today. üôåüèΩ"	0
There is a major problem when multinational or corporate bodies take a political stance . People do not go to work or play sport for a moral or political reason.

To not do so is discrimination and violates free speech.	0

Mulya - the difference is that homosexuals can consent to their sexual relations. All of the other situations you described there have a person who has not consented. If two adults consent to do something in the privacy of their bedrooms, what is the big problem? In most peoples opinion, the answer is nothing. Gokhan: I'm sorry, but I couldn't fully understand your question because of your English. I think the answer is something like: There are two sexes, men and women, and sometimes men like men, sometimes women like women, and there is no problem with that. Okay?	0

Thanks nisreena, there's no Religion gene too apparently. Perhaps we can start looking at the social, familial and environmental issues to cure you of your insanity - believing things for which there is no scientific proof for (I'm sure you'll relate to this, as you seem to favour the scientific method). Alternatively rather than try and cure you of being a Muslim I can accept you for who you are, respect you and the choices you've made in life and live in tolerance. In any event, even if it's a choice rather than genetic, so what.	1

"It was ruled to protect the citizens interest in obtaining affordable health care. ""The Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress and then signed into law by the President on March 23, 2010.

"So this is how liberty dies . . . With thunderous applause. Ladies and gentlemen, the Supreme Court just reneged on its constitutional duty to uphold the law of the land. The Supreme Court has indeed violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers and the Tenth Amendment, which specifically states that any authority not given to the federal government via our Constitution is a power that belongs to the states. As of today, religious liberty in America has been weakened to satisfy the Machiavellian demands of a vociferous few. The brainwashed populace now lauds this ruling in defiance of God's law and in violation of the Constitution of the United States. America has blindly acquiesced to the demands of the LGBT community in ignorance of the truth that their agenda poses an existential threat to the American Republic. Fellow Christians, it is time to stand up in defiance of this ruling and openly proclaim the truth regardless of the consequences. ""And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."" (John 8:32, NKJV). God help our United States of America!"	1

Why are y'all pointing out just one sin ! Your saying That homosexuals going to hell but didn't the lord said don't judge or you will be judge. All sin is equal all though some might be greater Then others but a sin is a sin. We don't get in heaven by good works we get in by believe Jesuschrist is our savior. And he isn't say you can't get saved only if your not a homosexual. So be careful Doubt , lie , pride, sex before marriage, lust, laziness all those are sins so stop pointing out one sin. Your not the lord to decide whether someone should go to hell.	0

none of you Americans seem willing to answer the question; why didn't this amazing doctor of yours examine Charlie? Or read his notes? Even though the GOSH doctors continuously invited him to do so, it took a COURT ORDER to get that doctor over here to examine him and, what a surprise, upon examination he concluded that Charlie was not for treatment despite what he was promising just the week before. Also had a financial interest and seemed to think the rareness of the disease should allow unashamed human experimentation. You might do that to American kids, but NHS won't!	0

You have no humility and could have very well been one of the people of decided to crucify Jesus and berate Mar√≠a Magdalena. Im not an ignorant I know your religion although I don't follow it. I believe there is somewhere something bigger then is but never would have I the nerve of declaring myself above fellow humans.

Discrimination is treating people whose situation is the same differently.

it's not immediately clear from your profile where in the world you are but, in case you are American, I think it is worth pointing out that, in the last 50 years 10.5k people have been killed as a result of terrorism across the whole of Western Europe. How many US citizens have been shot and killed by their fellow US citizens since Jan 1 this year? I'm thinking it's not far off 10.5k. It's certainly on course to exceed 10.5k by the end of the year. And that's just those who have been killed as a result of gun violence - it doesn't include those who have been wounded or suffered life altering injuries. Or, indeed, those who have been murdered by other means. And, don't even get me started on the unholy mess the orange spangletwat and his cohorts are trying to make of your healthcare system.

What if a woman/ transgender or whoever actually meet all the standards you listed? What if they are great at that? As you said, it should be based on standards and objective measurements of certain qualities. Maybe a lot of women/ transgender don't meet those standards, and it's totally fair that they don't fit in. However, some of them do meet those standards.

"Society intends to push various lies: 1) Everyone that doesn't agree with your choices is ""hateful"", ""fearful""(phobic), or ""bigot"", which is their favorite invented word. 2) To love, respect or feel empathy one have to accept everyone's choices. 3) That there's no compassion without acceptance. They're wrong, and they know it. No one needs to accept something wrong to be compassionate. No one has to renounce to their own criteria to comply with other people's decisions. I don't need violence or lies to express my point. And certainly, don't need to victimize myself to tell the truth."	0

The question isn't about God's love or God's law or even about gay marriage, except peripherally; it is about the rule of law and the United States Constitution, both of which were violated in both this ruling and the Obamacare ruling the day before. In both cases, the Supreme Court altered the statutes in question and completely ignored the Constitution they're sworn to uphold in order to rule as they did. Our federal courts are now officially corrupted and therefore illegitimate.	1

a big objection against gay marriage is that it turns marriage into a thing that is for the adults and its about what they want, and not about raising a kid, which the traditional marriage was about, a contract to stay together to make sure your kids get a good life. people worry marriage is becoming a play thing and that single parents are growing fast due to it	1

You're misunderstanding this. Yes, gender dysphoria is in the DSM V. (And no, if you don't know what that is you shouldn't even be trying to understand this issue.) But that doesn't make it a disorder. It's included to help those who suffer from it get insurance coverage and the mental health care that they need. Often people who aren't accepted for who they are become depressed, anxious, suicidal -- because whatdoyouknow living in an environment that is often openly hostile and unsafe can do that to a person. It isn't because any mental health professional thinks there is something inherently wrong with them. Actually, as a whole we're pretty accepting.	0

Gokhan: I understand why you say it isn't necessary. That's probably because same-sex relations can't pro-create. But marriage is a bond and a sign of love and respect, and gay couples can adopt children and marriage will help bring that family together, as well as the parents. It's not 'necessary' as far as any normal marriage is 'necessary', but it's something cherished and desired by many, many human beings.	0

"Hey, this was posted on Sunday at 4:38, by James aleo. Look up the comments: ""Some of the comments on this thread are really showing exactly why it is so difficult for people to come out still. I agree that my sex life is my own business, but my sexuality does not begin and end with sex. My partner and I live in the wider world, where no heterosexual person had to hide their sexuality, and can walk down the street holding hands, or give their partner a peck on the cheek when seeing them off at the railway station without fear of comment or disapproval, we have to watch our backs all the time if we wish to show each other the affection anyone else can do without fear. I have been the victim of abuse because of my sexuality more than once, and i think most LGBTQ people I know have. Legislation goes some way to refreshing the balance, but while some people still hold the opinion that we should hide who we are in public it will always be difficult. My sexuality is no one else's business, but I'm not going to hide it to make anyone else feel better either."" Coming out isn't a once in a lifetime thing, it needs be done every time you meet someone new and close"	0

Why are we as Christians either indignant or surprised at all of this it clearly says in the last days homosexuality as well as other things will be at an unpresident high God does love gay people no more or less than He loves me He might not like some of the things they do nor does he like some of the things I do. Don't for one minute think God uses the same 'scale' of sin as we do I screw up every day from being the person He would want me to be and actually the sadness for me is that there are some non Christians ( in fact quite a few) whose behaviour and attitude towards others are a whole lot better than some Christians I know . So people please think before you post God does not need us to defend Him He is ok to do that himself and thoughtless posts just reinforce the view some people have of us already which is another sadness	0

That means that statistically, 1/3rd of those with Gender dysphoria are already disqualified from service. Then you have to worry about which PT test they take, and what jobs they can and cant hold because of their sex. Then you have to worry about battle stress and PTSD affecting those who are already dealing with GD. No one is calling them less of a human. No one is ""taking away their rights"" the military is not about making exceptions, rather, building a force that can think and act as one cohesive unit, without questioning whether their battle buddy is up to saving their life at any time.

"God loves everyone ... How can they say it? How can they know what God loves or what He hates as long as they don't read or study God's word - The Bible? Because this is a lie! It's true: God is love, He loves the people who listen to him and who have high moral standards! But if they read God's word they will discover what it says in Romans 1:26,27, for exemple, ""That is why God gave them over to uncontrolled sexual passion, for their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; likewise also the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full penalty, which was due for their error"". The Bible makes it clear that God designed sex to be engaged in only between a male and a female and only within the arrangement of marriage, just like Genesis 1:27,28 says. I don‚Äôt hate homosexuals, but I can‚Äôt approve of their conduct. I reject homosexual conduct, not people. Also, I can't approve ""God loves everyone"" under these circumstances! Jesus didn‚Äôt encourage his followers to accept any and all lifestyles. Rather, he taught that the way to salvation is open to ""everyone exercising faith in him."" Exercising faith in Jesus includes conforming to God‚Äôs moral code, which forbids certain types of conduct - including homosexuality. I respect all sorts of people, but the argument or the justification ""God loves everyone"" hasn't been used right. Someone can say ""but this is love..."", well, I say IF YOUR LOVE FOR GOD AND FOR HIS PRINCIPLES IS BIGGER, THEN SURELY YOU'LL FIGHT FOR TO ABANDON THIS IMMORAL LIFESTYLE."	1

Sally-Ann & Margaret Hume. You clearly don't get what I was saying & quite frankly, what filthy language you use on social media. There's no fraternising in barracks during training process which lasts a year. Man & Women are separated for the training process. Also, the reason a man has less time to run x miles or is required to to x more than a women, is because men are naturally stronger than women. So if a man becomes a woman, he's still got the male structure & strength regardless if he's decided to stick some tits in & wearing makeup. He's still a man. Also, i never claimed to be a highly desirable man to any sex. I simply said that that there's a reason man & woman are separated & a man transitioned to a woman, will have a significant advantage over other women. It's why transgender will not be able to compete in sports. Because a man still has the strength & physique of a man regardless to what he tries to become. Men run faster, hit harder & perform better than women, because men have a higher level of fitness, strength & stamina than women. So putting a man now a women with women to compete is unfair to women born as a woman. Call me whatever names you like. You are & will always be the sex your born as. There's no way to physically prove your a women trapped in a mans body, yet it's had laws written for it. Stupid!	1

"The military discriminate. Every job in the world discriminates. In the military they discriminate against age 16-32 for example. They discriminate against people with disabilities of varying levels. Put simply this is because the main role of the military is to engage in war. So they pick from a niche of people that fit the criteria. It used to be a place where pc points weren't being scored, however that now is no longer the case. And every Tom dick and Harry wants to stick their ore in and tell those in the job, how their job should be run....as clearly indicated by some of the numpties on this feed. It is not that the military hate individuals who are transgender, just as they don't hate every person 40+ who do attempt to join, but are turned away. There are many reasons as to why Donald Trump has chosen this decision and i for one am in favour....however as of yet, I've heard no real reason for the against...apart from ""Why shouldn't they?!""....just because the accountancy firm down the street does. It is a completely unique environment and is nothing like the everyday civi jobs.

"Today is not a day to hate and it's assuredly not a day to rejoice over new ""freedoms."" Today is a day that I mourn. I mourn over a nation that calls good evil and evil good. I mourn over our nation that the world looks to that now, once again, takes the lead in leading the world astray. I mourn for those who say, ""This doesn't affect you so why do you care?"" because this does effect me, as I live in a nation coming under increased judgment, and because this does effect me, as my heart aches watching people drink sand in the desert believing it will satisfy. I mourn that God puts blessing and cursing before us, telling us to choose, and we time and again choose curses. I mourn over humanity who continues reaching to find satisfaction outside of Jesus but will never find it because there is no soul-deep satisfaction apart from the One who created us. ""There are many people outside the court today who are exuberant because they believe that what the court has done today will fulfill them and make them happy. Just like the woman at the well, who Jesus encountered, it won't do that."" I mourn for the true meaning of marriage being lost in all this, Christ loving the church and the church submitting to Jesus. I mourn for pastors and church leaders who, even though many still naively laugh at the idea, will soon face compromise or prison on this issue. I mourn for many followers of Christ who are tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine because of a lack of knowledge of God's Word and God's Will. I mourn for all those who boldly say ""Jesus loved all"" but don't understand that Jesus' love also called them to leave their life of sin and died a brutal death for our rebellion. And I mourn for the American church that either sits silently while the world collapses or screams hate from the sidelines. Yet today I am reminded that the Supreme Court can't put Jesus back in the tomb. Jesus is alive. He's still ruling and reigning. And He's coming back. How I ache and long for that day. But until that day comes I will continue to speak Truth, proclaim the Way, and show true Life. Jesus is the only answer for all our brokenness. Today I feel it more than most others - the Spirit and your true BRIDE say, ""COME LORD JESUS!"" AMERICA HAS FALLING"	1

"Again, please use logic, rather than falling back on Bronze Age fairytales. Murder and theft differ from homosexuality in many ways. The first and most obvious is that the former two have victims (and hurt others), while homosexuality does not (outside of STDs, which can and are also transmitted by heterosexuals). The second is that murder and theft are choices, whereas homosexuality is not. I'd like to make what should be an obvious assertion for the third difference: theft and murder are crimes, and homosexuality is not. Tragically, however, several countries are as caught up in their hateful religious dogma as you are, and so I'm unable to conclusively make that point. Instead, I'll posit that, in all civilised societies, theft and murder and crimes, whereas homosexuality is not. Even supposing that, of the thousands of religions, yours was somehow ""the right one"" (it clearly isn't), any God that casts people into hell for eternity for refusing to believe while simultaneously providing laughably limited evidence for their existence is not a god worth praising. I believe that we make our own salvation in life in our quest to find enlightenment and live as good people."	0

God isn't a thing, person or entity. You will die, and that will be it. No heaven, no hell, you will simply cease to exist. And all the individuals you're casting damnation upon will be perfectly fine, not a single thing will happen to them as a result of being homosexual, being immoral in your eyes or anything else you have a problem with for that matter. You and your evangelism do not matter in the slightest, you will wither away and fade into nothingness.	0

THANK YOU President Trump for keeping mental illness out of our military!

"From Sgt. Robert Brown US Army Nobody has a ""right"" to serve in the Military. Nobody. What makes people think the Military is an equal opportunity employer? Very far from it. The Military uses prejudice regularly and consistently to deny citizens from joining for being too old or too young, too fat or too skinny, too tall or too short. Citizens are denied for having flat feet, or for missing or additional fingers. Poor eyesight will disqualify you, as well as bad teeth. Malnourished? Drug addiction? Bad back? Criminal history? Low IQ? Anxiety? Phobias? Hearing damage? Six arms? Hear voices in your head? Self-identify as a Unicorn? Need a special access ramp for your wheelchair? Can't run the requred course in the required time? Can't do the required number of pushups? Not really a ""morning person"" and refuse to get out of bed before noon? All can be reasons for denial. The Military has one job. War. Anything else is a distraction and a liability. Did someone just scream ""That isn't Fair""? War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful. YOU change yourself to meet Military standards. Not the other way around. I say again: You don't change the Military... you must change yourself. The Military doesn't need to accomodate anyone with special issues. The Military needs to Win Wars. If any of your personal issues are a liability that detract from readiness or lethality... Thank you for applying and good luck in future endeavors. Who's next in line?"	0

"Since people can't see the forest from the trees they think this is just another reason to cry and scream about social justice. If this is suddenly an issue for you, then where are you on the following which will/can disqualify you from service: ADHD Needing insulin shots Having bad teeth Color blind Bad eye sight Having flat feet Depression I could go on and on, the list is quite extensive. Here's the thing, the military views the effectiveness of soldiers on their cost. It cost money (tax payer money at that) to pay for soldier X's insulin or soldier B's ADHD meds. If they don't take their meds they are a liability to not only themselves but to the other soldiers around them on the battlefield. Being on extremely expensive hormone therapy can cause extreme side effects including osteoporosis, fatigue, increased risk of diabetes and heart attacks/strokes, weight gain, decreased muscle mass, anemia, and memory loss. So not only an expensive treatment, but potentially extremely expensive side effects...I haven't even touched the possible mood swings and other behavioral effects which again would be all on the tax payer's dime. So the military isn't going to pay for your possible surgeries or your drugs, much like it won't for a multitude of other things. So before you get your panties in a bunch, why aren't you out there protesting for the ""rights"" of colorblind people? The answer is cause it's not the hot topic of the moment. The military isn't your social experiment, and for all it's faults it may have I can't see where you would classify this any differently then trying to maximize effectiveness. A lot of people don't realize how picky the military actually is."	0

"That is an extremely generalised view, Efrem. The majority of gay and lesbian people simply wish to be accepted as ordinary citizens with the same rights as everyone else. After all, why not? They pay the same taxes as ""straight"" people. Bisexuals are similar, except they wish to have the right to have sex with both sexes. Transsexuals are different altogether. They do not see themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual. However, they expect society to, not only accept the wishes of an EXTREMELY minute number of people but change society's accepted norms and change to accommodate them"	0

Lol as someone who is gay we tend to have a better idea of the percentage because frankly closeted guys would NEVER tell people like you about their true sexuality.

This includes people who are slightly bisexual, and I can't even count on two hands how many times a supposedly hetero dude came up to me and started feeling me up. So yeah, you guys really do know nothing. Your head would spin, and you would probably implode if you actually knew how many of your friends are secretly gay. ;)	0

Also, your people were brought over as slaves and indoctrinated into believing in the Christian representation of a higher entity.

Yes, and your point is entirely fallacious. Just because we have a 'word' for something, it doesn't mean we 'believe' in it. The punishment of witchcraft was prolific in the middle ages, and so on, as was the belief in magic in general. Unlike your populace, however, we believe in reality now :D I did do some research, and provided you with evidence which you obviously chose to ignore. You do realise that a belief in witchcraft isn't necessarily divisible from Christian or Islamic belief? Never heard of the inquisition, have you? The belief in witchcraft is a predominate part of traditional African village spirituality, and it hasn't been curtailed by Abrahamic religion, only intensified.	0

In conclusion, our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated (not transitioned) FtM transsexuals are closer to the pattern of subjects who share their gender identity (males) than to those who share their biological sex (females). Our results provide evidence for structural differences in the untreated FtM transsexual‚Äôs brain. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610001585?via%3Dihub	0

The reason that there is such high mental health problems amongst transgender people is due to their treatment in society. They are constantly seen as second class citizens.

+1 The arguments here, for and against, aren't doing society any favours. The Australian people have long wanted marriage equality. The liberal party has been the hold up in achieving that by maintaining the party line for the last ten years and not allowing their own party members a conscience vote. The labour party has been supportive of a conscience vote for years. The stupid thing about this whole process is that it's not binding, only if a yes vote gets up will a vote happen in parliament and (liberal) politicians have already said that they're not going to be bound by the public vote. Total waste of taxpayers money. The liberal party is more interested in sucking up to its base than the consensus of the people of Australia as a whole.	0

What's the church got to do with marriage? It's a civil ceremony sometimes adorned with religious trimmings and sometimes performed in a church. Why did they oppose it for so long?

"So how many days has this mentally ill person missed for to transgender issues or sex change issues? Let's talk facts and real science. Genetically there are two genders in our species male and female. They make up 99.93 percent of the population as either XY or XX chromosome pairs. The remainder are mutation variations. The science is settled 96.2% of doctors and scientists agree. Any guess what group the remainder belong to and why they disagree? The science is settled, transgenderism is a mental disorder!

For forty years as the University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School‚Äîtwenty-six of which were also spent as Psychiatrist in Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital‚Äîhe has been studying people who claim to be transgender. He notes this is a perception disorder (Gender Dysphoria) that must be treated as such or extremely detrimental consequences will likely occur. He cites a long term study that indicates high rates of suicide and other severely dysfunctional behavior: ""The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people‚Äîextending over thirty years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered‚Äîdocuments their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to fifteen years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to twenty times that of comparable peers."" http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/ Gender : The state of being male or female. Male : denoting the sex that produces gametes, especially spermatozoa. Female : sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs.

it matters because ultimately marriage is a social contract, which is binding in the eyes of the law. Just like any other 'contract' social or otherwise, it is bound to have consequences that effect the society in general, matters relating to property law, trust law, law of inheritance etc etc. All these aspects that are bound to have an issue with other peoples lives requires a referendum, especially in a non- homogeneous, colonised and immigrant heavy nation.	0

Exactly my point Ruth Grant i think we live in world where we must accept that we cant always see eye to eye but we can still be friends and respect each other because to be honest any other way will just bring chaos and hate and i dont think anything good can come from hating one another but a lot can be achieved through mutual respect	0

I can't imagine how would a naked soldier girl have felt if she had taken shower together with a naked transgender ""men"" in the bathroom for women? By the way, i think that the number of transgenders willing to join any army is so small that this is not a problem but only an artificially triggered squabble between politically correct leftists and republicans."	1

"This issue has nothing to do with ""Religion"", but ""simple moral sense"". It is quite unfortunate that the United State of America is now easily influenced by muddy minds and ill-using the word ""Human Right"". With current trends, in our life time, you will see the same U.S. Supreme Court legalizing : a) the right of a father to legally marry and have sex with his daugthers. b) the right of a mother to legally marry and have sex with her sons. c) the right of a woman to legally marry and have sex with her dog (animal). d) the right of a person to walk totally nake on american streets. e) the right of couples to legally have sex on american streets. f) the right of workers to legally have sex in their offices. g) the right of a woman to remarry and without divorce. Yes! Because there are thousands of americans that are deeply and already involved in these (justifiable) acts and their RIGHTS need to be respected as well. In fact, a couple or coupling means so much in nature. Even in engineering, male-female coupling is the thing. Its gonna be a waste of time and psychopathic working out a female-female and male-male couplings. I believe you wont wanna fly in an aeroplane put together with such odd couplings."	1

So what you're saying is that transgendered people are incapable of fighting, winning conflicts and they're a social experiment? Have you ever talked, like actually had a decent conversation with someone who's trans? Here's a secret; you might have interacted with one without even knowing. Transgendered and lgbt people have to handle hate, discrimination and sometimes violent acts towards them. And most still stay true to who they are. If that's not being strong and capable of handling conflict then I don't know what else to say. And yes, I haven't fought in a war, but it's not people who identify as transgender who are going to ruin the chances of winning a fight/war. Oh and just like you said; people who have not been in the military or intend on joining shouldn't comment on this, then guess what? If you don't identify as transgender or support trans rights, educate yourself before you talk about something you know nothing about.	0

It's unfortunate that you will waste you time justifying your love for God on facebook, but will fail to go to church on His day. Have some respect for other people, yourself, and God. You do not have to sit around a camp fire, holding hands with everyone who identify themselves in the LGBTQIA community and sing happy songs, but you do have to respect people and not slander a day they celebrate their life of individuality and remember those who's lives were taken due to them being in the community. If you do not like it, keep it on your own profile, where people who are individual chose to IGNORE and MOVE ON with the rest of their day. I bless you in the name of the Lord, and hope when your Day of Judgement comes, God will forgive your in spite of your hatefullness. Have a gay day!	0
Was that supposed to sound smart or really dumb? Because that whole line of reasoning is kinda dumb.	0
To be fair the UK has a very high gay population and the UK have been one of the first countries to recognize and understand the LGBT communities it has been more of a taboo topic in the united States until recently .. You also have to add in the factors that the UK and Europe are athiest countries and don't believe in God and it's the immigrants who are living in the UK that actually keep God alive and attend mosque, churches etc .. In the united states people are still very religious and attend a place of worship weekly .. And it's not because they are transgendered that's the problem .. The problem is how to get hormone therapy treatments ( which is a life long commitment ) on to the battle fields and across the seas when you are doing your tour of duty ? Being without the medication the transgender needs can be a dangerous situation that's what the concerns are about not them being transgenders . the military also doesn't let people who don't finish high school , or people with face and neck tatoos or people with mental illnesses or health problems into the military so if a guy who was trans and couldn't get his hormone pills could become suicidal and that is a mental state that could endanger the troops .. We have to look at every issue for the safety and well being of all lives ..	0

Not true Peter Bayliss. I am not religious but many gay people are because they believe God loves everyone. Modern Christianity which was started in Roman times was created at a time when men and men and women and women were freely married to each other in the same way as men and women. The Romans decided what Christianity was and each generation adapted it to their wants, needs and beliefs. Everyone is free to believe what the wish without being told they don't deserve that belief.	0
But if people it made created sins, and that it loves them, isn't it suppose to love sins as well ?	0

A good Church is bible based and reflects every aspect of whats written. It does not pick and choose which scripture to follow or disobey to fit into their own lives, or whatever has become acceptable to the world. Its leaders (still human and sinners) are suppose to be the example, so (unfair as it may be) held to a higher standard.

"I don't think the coming out itself is going to go away. The stress of it is going to diminish as visible non-heterosexual people will become ever more common-place. But two things, to my mind, will not change anytime soon: 1) The majority of people is and will continue to be (predominantly) straight. So the expectation will continue to be that anyone who doesn't give clear indications otherwise will be assumed straight. 2) Any revelation about people's most private affairs - a big part of which is made up by all things sexual - will continue to be greeted with sensationalist glee, in private circles and the media alike. As long as these two assumptions hold, the phenomenon of the coming out itself will not go away even as the ""stigma"" continues to fade away."	0

"So how many days has this mentally ill person missed for to transgender issues or sex change issues? Let's talk facts and real science. Genetically there are two genders in our species male and female. They make up 99.93 percent of the population as either XY or XX chromosome pairs. The remainder are mutation variations. The science is settled 96.2% of doctors and scientists agree. Any guess what group the remainder belong to and why they disagree? The science is settled, transgenderism is a mental disorder! Paul McHugh, MD, is University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School and the former psychiatrist in chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital. For forty years as the University Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School‚Äîtwenty-six of which were also spent as Psychiatrist in Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital‚Äîhe has been studying people who claim to be transgender. He notes this is a perception disorder (Gender Dysphoria) that must be treated as such or extremely detrimental consequences will likely occur. He cites a long term study that indicates high rates of suicide and other severely dysfunctional behavior: ""The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people‚Äîextending over thirty years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered‚Äîdocuments their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to fifteen years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to twenty times that of comparable peers."" http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/06/15145/ Gender : The state of being male or female.

I've heard from army people that having a woman around changes things - because , as a man, your first instinct is to protect her, even if it goes against your remit as a soldier who's supposed to be doing something else. So I'm not sure about whether all this `gender rights' thing applies in the army, where things happen so quickly and you can get conflicted already in so many ways about what's the `right' thing to do. It does seem to me to complicate things that are already horrific. I think `gender rights' should gracefully remove themselves from warfare situations for that reason.	0

"everything happening in the universe is natural. The universe has no magic, no science fiction. Homosexuality is just a phenomenon that scientists are still trying to explain, but that doesn't really affect the species in any way. Gay people are just people with different preferences or likes. If that phenomenon was unnatural, it would be like ""God"", but what we all see is that it's a real thing that you can actually identify in society. Being gay doesn't have ANYTHING to do with being male or female. Get yourself together. Now, things happen genetically or behaviorally speaking... we are all changing everyday due to mutations, but the mutations that really have an impact on us are those that occurred before birth. Changes in the genes can lead us to be or act differently, that's probably why I'm gay, that's probably why some people are trans, that's probably why some people are taller than others, other people is born with different skin color, and others with syndromes that are harmful for them. But no matter what result you are, no one should ever discriminate you because nature made you a certain way....... IT IS TOO RETROGRADE. Roy Taylor... LEARN how nature and life work so you can actually use them as arguments."	0

Ditto back at conservatives arguing about states rights when it comes to guns, religion, education and environmental issues... but guess what?! Those issues will bleed over into other states aka Chicago gun violence. Chicago/Illinois has very strict gun laws however... the state right beside it doesn't. Hop the boarder get your guns then come back in without telling anyone. Pollution: one state has shitty rules up the river system. Businesses pollute the streams and rivers above states with strong rules against that... it becomes a federal problem. I'm all for states rights when it only effects your state and doesn't bleed over into others. Also how can you be so fucking mean to justify a woman's jailing when she was at a hospital for cancer... assign a person to her, let the doctors do their work then deport her. She could die.	1

I believe its a curse more than a choice = Romans 1: 21Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 24Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. 26For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.	1

Let me educate your FB people. It's a logistics nightmare. Let me explain: currently you can't JOIN in the military if you have any medical conditions that require constant treatment or excessive accommodation. That's why people with asthma, diabetes, permanent STD's/STI's (like HIV), people with cancer or a recurring history of cancer and individuals with physical disabilities can't serve (except in very rare cases where a specific waiver is granted). Transgender individuals require hormone replacement therapy, they require psychiatric care during transition, and if they elect to get surgery it can take 2-4 years for them to recover to the point of being eligible to deploy. On top of that, after the surgery they are at a higher risk of infection for the rest of their life, which complicates any attempt at sending them to the field to train where hygiene isn't always able to be pristinely maintained or overseas. An overseas deployment also puts the individual at risk because they may not have steady access to their hormone replacement drugs, which leads to withdrawal and hormone imbalances as well as health problems. So, just like diabetics and cancer patients and individuals with physical or mental disabilities, it just isn't feasible to accommodate these people so that they can serve	1

Jeremy....your words sound eloquent 4 sure. You are fighting a losing battle because what you seek can not be found in another human being....it is a desire to be truly loved and accepted...only God our Creator can do that for us.

Just another Trump dick riding bigot. Nothing new	1
the simple answer to your question could be that the default or norm is heterosexuality (after all only a small percentage of people are homosexual) and thus this is what we assume of people we meet. We interact with them accordingly, for example by flirting or even going so far as to imagine marriage. It is therefore useful for our surroundings to be able to adjust our expectations. For example (perhaps a poor one), if I am entirely color blind (which very few people are), what would be the use of searching for a beautifully colored present for me? If I assume your hearing is perfect, I would talk to you, perhaps even with my back to you, but what if you weren't? If you know your friend is a devout Muslim, would you invite her over for pork chops? Having different abilities or desires, doesn't change the fact that you are a human and should be treated with the same respect as all other humans, it just means that in some daily interactions we may need to change our behavior towards them.	0

"Coming out is one of the hardest things a person will have to do. Yes the world has come along way, but there are still so many homophobic people that think they have the right to express their opinion on whom one falls in love with. Also sometimes I feel I need to come out on an almost daily basis, people presume you are heterosexual so there is always the ""well actually ....."". Believe me, I hate having to be forced to explain my family circumstances to a random stranger because of a remark or question about my private life, but I won't lie about it either. I am sure Kezia didn't want to make a big deal of her relationship in the media - she was forced to by a pathetic journalist who thought it was a big deal and would therefore sell a few papers.

""God"" is the mute that talks the most: ""god said this, god said that..). Any proofs of that?..none...for ever. Religion is a plague that prevents human kind to evoluate with full exploitation of their intellectual capacities (and don't think that we are so smart, mankind is the most damageable specie on earth...a god's creature, right? Besides that, gay people deserve respect (I have several gay friends who are just great people:)) but these should remain within some boundaries to avoid offending heterosexuals.

By accepting you're gay you're accepting that a conventional life will not be possible. By choosing not to tell others you cutting yourself off from real relationships. Even at work you're only half a person not able to talk about family, relationships or daily existence. Others may think, you're a bit of a sad sack or they may suspect that you are gay. By telling others you are risking rejection or worse, abuse. The fear of this can build up in your head and become a monster. However easy going we are told society is becoming, and this exaggerated, it is our interactions with those individuals we love and know that counts when we are coming out.	0

"an article from an unreliable ""news"" source sharing the opinion of ONE controversial person is not enough to prove to anyone that being transgender is a mental disorder. Being transgender itself is not an illness; the mental problems come after people like you go on the internet and make those who are already struggling with something deeply personal (which is also none of your business) feel isolated and antagonized for being who they are. My tips for you: 1) find multiple RELIABLE sources before you declare something to be ""proven"" 2) take your judgement and hurtful statements somewhere else. The internet has enough of that already."	0

I think the main argument is that the medical treatment costs a lot of money, so it's being treated as a pre-existing condition.

"I see your point and understand it. Your right in a lot of ways. However, actively calling trans people fucking weird and using words like ""shemale"" contribute to the idea that trans people are not normal or therefore worthy of being treated equally. The right thing to do, in any case really, is to try and be empathetic and understanding if someone's struggles, and educate yourself on what you can do to fight for equality rather than use language that is inherently harmful. It's just a moral choice to do the right thing and try to help rather than go on about how you don't understand. Start to understand. Make an effort, the information is everywhere."	0

You're right. But if by sex your a man, how can you then be classified by gender as a women? You're still a man & should be classified as a man. I have nothing against how people live their lives as long as it doesn't have any negative impact on anyone else's. No one has any right to live a life at the detriment of others. But we're now being forced to share changing rooms, toilets with someone of a different sex to us. Put it this way, a mother can be naked in the same room as their teenage daughter, for example in changing rooms or when trying on clothing. A father can be the same with his son. However, a father cannot with the daughter or mother with the son. Because it's indecent. So re classifying gender doesn't mean you now can. So if the law states your of the opposite sex, that makes you a man.	1

Torture and spreading fear to force people to believe in God? A literal massacre and near extinction of Native Americans in the name on Christianity? Indoctrination of children worldwide and instilling fear into them over something that doesn't exist? Even according to the Bible (for which you obviously take as fact), God killed more than 20 million people. Satan killed 2. Nothing to be proud of. When the last time has gay people murdered millions of people to convert them to be homosexual? Do you see gay people whipping pinned lashes and burning people in public to make them gay and as a warning to what would happen if you weren't gay? Because LGBT+ people fight for equality, diversity and love, including heterosexuality. Rather the opposite of your religion. If there's ever such thing as hell, you know you're going there since you're so full of hatred and condone mass murder and violence.	0

Read the Bible, dipstick, so u'll find out. And ask in Sodom and in Gomorrah.	1
some people mix up God's dislike of certain behaviors with the people themselves, so they may say that God hates homosexuals. These people are of the belief that homosexuality is a sin in God's eyes and that a marriage union is only acceptable if it is between a man and a woman. Yet, we are all sinners, Christian and non-Christian teens alike, and God loves us all. Every single person, homosexual or not, is special in God's eyes. Sometimes it is about our own views of our behaviors that lead us to believe we are less special in God's eyes. If you are of a denomination that has deemed homosexuality as a sin, you may be faced with guilt about your same-sex attraction. However, it is your own guilt that makes you think that God loves you less.	0

"remember Sodom and Gomorrah, History wasnt ment to be repeated you know Why do people never read the Bible? Sodom was an anti rape story and Gomorrah was a passing mention. And you think this is history? LMAO Claims he has ""nothing but love towards all people"" Calls homosexuality ""disgusting"" ""irregardless of their lifestyle choices however disgusting they may be"" So you shouldn't have any problem with homosexuality then, seeing as it's not a lifestyle choice. ""but the truth still needs to be said, someone needs to speak out against this new found freedom to sin, have you no shame?"" The truth needs to be shown to be true. Demonstrate it is, objectively, a sin and we will listen. Says ""i urge you to read the Holy Bible and learn the truth"" Doesn't understand Sodom was an anti rape story ""am sorry you need to go back and read the Bible, or anything that improves thought"" ""The Bible"" and ""something that improves thought"" shouldn't be in the same sentence. ""Homosexuality is wrong"" That which can be asserted without evidence may be dismissed without evidence. ""Lennart Roos, the same way murders, thieves, peverts, R Kelly affects me, they are infringing on my freedom to practice my faith and to a peaceful life"" If people you don't even know affect you that much, you may want to reprioritize. ""i mean realy, how am i supposed to live a peaceful life when i hear gay this and gay that everytime i turn on the news, gays should hide their gayness, HIDE IT, aint no1 wanna know, Stay in the closet and STOP fighting for rights that heterosexual people enjoy, yall not on the same level"" What was that you said above?

But it always considered like a rare cases in the community .. but when its officially announced by the leaders And becomes available to everyone . Thats baaaaaad .. Like we Challange Godwill .. Maybe a man married a man looks fine to you right now . And you may consedir it like a freedom and a humain right .. but it will turn up bad on the futur .. it will roun the whol society ..

they can, but the argument is near 100% about what 2 adults want and their rights ect... no one mentions the point of the marriage beyond the title and bit of paper you sign. im just raising a point ive heard a few times now. that people see all this marriage arguments as missing the point of what it was in the first place, the contract to stay together for the good of the family, at least until they are old enough to not be effected. the idea of a marriage been not that serious and everyone can have one then just split up is seen as removing the drive and social expectation to stay as a couple to raise a kid. obviously alot of factors in single parent rates, but devils advocate, that is a legit worry people have	1

Muck of the cause of this refugee crisis is the EUs failed polices.And Europe has endangered itself by letting in so many.And these people live by different laws,an other political systems or form of government that directly opposes freedom and Democracy.And that other form of government is Islam.And yes Islam is a form of government,just like Democracy,Communism,Fascism,Nazism... but a lot different... for it has its own laws,Sharia law,which is absolute, and its own religion with is entangled in to ever thing and binds it all to gather... with make this form of government very dangerous. And with in a year or two Europe is going to exploded into violence and war as this two different political systems collide.Because Freedom,Democracy and human rights can not exist with Islam and Sharia law,there two opposites that cannot exist together.	1

It's funny how your government makes you obsessed with immigration while silently taking away all your rights and privileges as citizens. They like to blame immigrants for all their failures as the leadership. While people on the bottom fight and argue with each other (locals vs immigrants, whites vs blacks, Muslims vs non-Muslims), your elite is seizing power and removing your only real power which is spending power. They are pushing house prices out of your reach so there's fewer landlords to control, the rest of people are pushed into a lifetime debt (payday loans, massive mortgages for those who can afford them, student loans at ¬£9000 a year, energy prices up by 10% every year, less national healthcare so you pay privately etc..). Do you really think that when you leave the eu (the only body that protects your rights from becoming peasants and serving the elite in 'new monarchy') will somehow magically change your country into a promised land ? Ever heard of foreign business, foreign investment, globalisation, British exports and what really drives UKs economy (finance and business management)? It makes me laugh to see so many 'immigration experts' without any economic or business understanding whatsoever.	1

"This is a neo fascist/nazi party with no moral boundaries. The vast migration has triggered the swedish people to put their vote on them, but they have been around long before any immigrants coloured our white suburbs. As a swede who grew up with Palme and social equality, heartfelt solidarity and an unprecedented welfare-system, I am in agony and actually planning for future underground resistance or me leaving Sweden. I am not alone, most swedes are as concerned as me, but political uncertainty still makes SD the largest party among a lot of semi-big ones. There is no way that the Sweden Democrats (i.e. the nazi security service, SD) can lead the country or lead to anything else than surpluse lessons that Sweden never got to learn in WW2. Our country is just a couple of years away (elections are in 2018 and SD is now the largest party in polls, making them eager for a fast re-election and a fast take-over) from being hijacked by a malevolent ""party"" with a bloodline straight from the SS highquarters (evidence based, please check it out) in Berlin 1942. Check the sources and you will find it is for real. Sounds like sci-fi but sadly is not. In the 90's there was a political movement among the neo nazis that collected them with fascist forces. Street violence drastically fell and people experienced an eerie silence, going from neo nazis murdering and battering of those in opposition: homosexuals, immigrants, ""lefties"" etc, to an appreciated parliamentary movement. The SD, formed by old nazis in 1988, left the uniforms and sieg heils behind them and organized themselves in a ""political"" party, SD. Today, their accomplishments are uniting and focusing racist, fascist and nazi groups, spreading propaganda that supports and leads to racist murderings and arson. This will soon be everyone's problem, no matter nationality. So please ‚Äì UN, GB, US ‚Äì anyone. Help. Make sure that the World community does not accept a regime that stands against civil rights, free speech and democracy. Do not allow the worst parts of our history to repeat itself. Use the UN declaration of human rights to shed a light on this abomination!"	1

"Oh dear, it must be a difficult time for those in the LIBLABCON and their criminal chums. Everything they believe in is crumbling before their eyes. Their belief in no borders and allowing the Third World in, and everyone breeding so we will all be brown and superior to what was before. It's not happening. Also unfortunately for them, the people who have come here, and into the rest of Europe, already have a strong identity, and have no intention of giving up their culture nor religion. Unlike these cowards and traitors the newcomers are also strong mentally and have real convictions. However wrong and stupid they are. The LIBLABCON are so desperate and clueless they ignore the newcomers abuse of women, abuse of children, and hatred of Homosexuals. They say nothing of Muslim women forced to cover up, because in Islam women are the property of men and seen as sexual beings who need to be controlled. What happened to the rights of women and feminism? Muslims slaughtering a load of young people at a concert in Paris, leaves the LIBLABCON punch drunk their revered immigrants killing people instead of been compliant and just so grateful. Sweden, once one of the most safest countries in the world, has now become the rape capital of the world, directly because of Islamic immigration. The PC Government who control the media in Sweden, try to cover up the rape of women by not reporting it. If they do report a rape of a Swedish woman by Muslim colonizers, they say the attackers were ""Swedish men"". Where are the outspoken Swedish feminists? The LIBLABCON and their criminal chums are in DENIAL. Denial can often be fatal. Wake up..."	1

I have no issue with migrants or refugees, as long as they adopt our way of life and culture. What shouldn't happen is leave a Islamic country and come to the western natiin and try and force Islamic belief on our nation and public sector organisation. If you want to follow a religion that's fine, but don't enforce it on anyone, keep it to ya self, just as I keep my belief and values to my self. To many people following religion preach to others about the rights and wrongs, when statically religious followers commit the worst sins.	1

The Swedish industry has never been as profitable as it is now - it is just that the money goes into the rich's pockets and then to the Cayman Islands. This has the right wing parties arranged but it is easier to blame immigrants and refugees. We estimate that the cost of refugees will be 60 billion SEK but no one says anything about that the right wing parties bought a German coal power plant called Nuon and the Swedish taxpayers lost 90 billion SEK on that deal. These people has manure instead of brains.	1

Next year even moore, if you dont know this its beacus of the increadble lies the current goverment spreads which is also the main reason for SD current succes.

He's not stating facts though. You know what happened last year in America? Adorable couple of Syrian-Americans and a teen girl were brutally murdered by a white Christian neighbor. Those Syrians - dentistry student and art student - full of hope and smile, are the examples of immigrants too. Read about 2015 Chapel Hill Shooting. You perceive Muslims only as a threat, and that is simply not true, and it has never been true. America has their own social problems, and yes, it has problems with ethnic-based violence and gangs. But guess what? A lot of them descent from Asia, a lot of them are hispanics, a lot of them are of European descent. Russian mobs, drug cartels etc - Americans know a lot about it. And guess what?

Race to the bottom.. Sweden to become a Third World Country by 2030, according to UN: According to UN projections, Sweden will be a much poorer country by 2030, much worse than what anyone in the Swedish government indicates. The UN report HDI (Human Development Index) predicts a significant decrease in Swedish prosperity, unlike their Nordic neighbors, who will retain their top positions and even strengthen them globally in the long run. In 2010 Sweden had the 15th place in the HDI rankings but according to UN forecasts, Sweden will be #25 in 2015, and in 2030 on the 45th place. Sweden is one of few countries with such a sharp deterioration from what it had in 2010. Fewer ends up on welfare dependency in their Nordic neighboring countries while Sweden continues to have a greater amount of family households forced to live on welfare, which are a couple factors causing the dropped global competitiveness. Negative developments, or rather liquidations can be exemplified by Orrefors Kosta Boda, which in 1992 had 940 employees in Sweden and was a profitable industry. Today less than 100 remain in the company after further cost reductions and adaptations in order to meet global competition. Most of today's less developed countries such as Cuba, Mexico, the Baltic countries and Bulgaria according to the 2030 UN report will be passing Sweden in prosperity. Even Greece, which today is more or less bankrupt, but will be on 13th place by 2030.	0

I feel as though people are far too Black-and-white on immigration issues. There is a gray area. I believe these people are mostly good natured, however the reality is they like are ultimately going to consume more resources that contribute especially as the current Swedish gov doubles down on increasing the immigration/refugee intake ratio. Sweden is not receiving waves of engineers, doctors, bankers, skilled tradesmen... most of these people accustomed to low-paying occupations such as street vendors, small store owners who go into debt to start a business in Sweden, and service/call centre workers. Many more are unemployed, some areas such as Rosengard in Malmo, there is >70% unemployed. Rosengard is a mostly Iraqi, Lebanese and Somali populated area. It's not all sunshine and lollipops Liberals vs. evil Neo Nazis. I dont believe in deportation whatsoever unless warranted. These people need to be educated and driven into more skilled occupations and better immersed into Swedish culture. Far-right organizations lure in people who are simply fed up with seeing legitimate slums forming in their cities and towns. Their worries should also be considered and addressed.	0

US war against Europe, 4 steps //// The USA is at war against EU. The current wave of forced migration has been promoted and funded by US intelligence. The war against EU has had at least 4 steps: a) financial crisis 2008 (generated in US but with huge impact on EU economy) b) arab spring (promotion of wars in EU neighborhood and generation of chaos in EU borders) c) maidan and new cold war against Russia (breaking any possible partnership between EU and the Russian Federation) d) massive exodus of migrants, only 20% of them real refugees and some of them members of ISIS and other US funded jihadist organizations. When you analyze the pictures of dead babies you may arrive to the conclusion that there is something rotten in all the massive exodus (funded and organized by US intelligence services) coming to Europe using the strange route Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary (three countries hostile to US foreign policy and that still are doing business with the Russian Federation). http://www.voltairenet.org/article187588.html	1

Muslims are not Pokemon. You don't have to collect them all. Migration is a good thing, but it has to be responsible. It can't be done in a way that harms the people. It also can't be done in a way that makes the bulk of the people pay for it through increased taxes or reduction of services, or worse, both. As for the assertion that the SDU are racists, well, the extreme left of Sweden needs to take a damn good hard look at themselves and the anti white, anti swedish culture rubbish that their own parties carry on with. The same anti white racism that permeates the extreme left press across the world. This is what loses the regressive left their support base amongst the reasonable left wing, like myself. When all you see are right wingers everywhere, that means that you've become too far left.	0

"women are to cover in christianity when in prayer... we're supposed to stay prayerful so a christian having on a kemar isn't against there religion it is ALSO part of christianity. ""Christian headcovering is the veiling of the head by women in a variety of Christian traditions. Some cover only in public worship, while others believe they should cover their heads all the time. The Biblical basis for headcoverings is found in 1 Corinthians 11:2‚Äì16.[1] Though head covering was practiced by most Christian women up until the 1960s,[2] it is now a minority practice among contemporary Christians in the West, although it remains the norm in the East."	0

Why not? If you have a problem with immigration as a whole, as the SD purports, then that would apply to anyone from anywhere. If you are actually just racist, then you would make that distinction. Btw, you included muslim are a non-european nationality. Pretty sure that Muslim doesn't constitute a nationality and that there are a ton of muslim europeans.	0

If we're going to go on about foreigners, especially ones from Europe, then why not start with the upper class hypocrites who live off the state? The Queen is married to a Greek asylum seeker. The Tories and UKIP aren't against immigration. The main reason the Tories voted against a minimum wage was so they can exploit cheap foreign labour from third world countries. They're only against the EU because it has rights for workers such as enough breaks. The Tories and UKIP don't care about Britain and British people. They sold off nearly everything public owned in the 80s to the highest bidders. Then by the early 90s and after much tax that affects the poor the most such as constant VAT increases, and being the first to add tax to household bills, said they were too broke to put any money into what services were left, making then the worst in Europe.	0

"To all those making the profoundly ignorant remark about the Gulf States not taking in any Syrian refugees. Firstly, you should acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have made, despite being far less wealthy than Europe or the oil-rich Gulf countries. Secondly, if you are going to criticize Saudi Arabia and Co, you should also have the intellectual honesty to then also slam the only other democracy in the region as well, namely Israel. Israel has taken in exactly ZERO refugees from any country, including non-Muslim black Africans. These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are MORONS. Seriously? Let me get this straight: you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to - SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter. The Gulf States on the other hand are ruled by Sunnis, some having Shia minorities. And finally, some Syrians are in fact moving to Saudi Arabia in secret, provided they have plenty of money (I know this for a fact)."	1

There is a definate distinction from those who are genuine refugees and those who are migrants. The problem here is just who is who, and if these people continue to flant every euro countries borders controls with constant demands to be given the right to just walk or force their way through borders, this can only lead to unrest and further outbreaks of violence. Law and order of border controls are there for a good reason. A civilised approach by all those 'on the march' would see a more sympathetic responce from countries that are affected by an invasion on their lands.	1

Oh it's getting really hard being Switzerland after the Banks' criminal business models got dismantled and the EU is getting sick and tired of Switzerland's cherry picking. Every negotiation is getting harder and the government has to make more concessions. The end result will be that we'll a lot of the same obligations as an EU member without having all of the benefits and above all, no vote. We'realready paying billions into the cohesion funds for new EU members and into various other EU funded projects so we can still take part in the European free market. We're not that special anymore. The UK, while being 8 times bigger in terms of population, has a GDP that's only five times that of Switzerland. And as with Switzerland, most of it comes from the banking sector. While Cameron can currently protect The City from stricter banking regulations within the EU, that option wil evaporate once the UK leaves the EU. There will be no more leverage. Britan's banking industry will be made to comply witht the much stricter banking laws that are undoubtely being passed without the restistance of the British government.	0

One must not forget, that the Swedish Democrats only got 13% of the votes. That leaves 87% of the population not voting for them.

I am taken aback by the negativity and ignorance on here from some contributors. Where is your humanity? How can you say, in all conscience, that we should not donate to help the refugees? I say, 'there but for the grace of God, go I' and I would hope, were I in their tragic situation, that kindness would prompt good people to help me and my family. Before you say to me that we should help our own first, I have done that, am doing that and will continue to do that in what ever way possible. I mention what follows purely to illustrate that I am not ignoring the need that exists here in this country. I am not blowing my own trumpet and I don't care what you think about me. I don't have a lot of money but I work and volunteer (including previously working for a homeless charity - my way of helping since I cannot donate huge cash amounts). I try to meet need where I find it in a small way. I have donated a gift filled shoe box for an elderly person in need; I am collecting tins of Christmas food for a food bank. I made a small donation to this collection - because it broke my heart watching the faces of the people struggling out of the sea and hearing their stories of people dying around them, and seeing the body of a little boy on the beach. Many of you sound angry. Anger is driven by fear. I'm frightened too - of the mess we're in here and in Syria and what might happen - but I will not let my fear turn me into someone who is incapable of helping others in desperate need - of what ever race or religion. The human need comes first for me, the religion and race are not relevant.	0

Instead of caricaturing the whole Muslim and Islamic community, I would suggest you do some more research. If this is the standard of someone who is already studying, then I weep for humanity! SIGNS OF THE MODERN DAY KHARIJITES (EXTREMISTS & TERRORISTS): (1) They will be young in age (Sahih Muslim & Bukhari); (2) They will be brainwashed (Ibid); (3) They will have thick, unkempt beards (Ibid); (4) Their faith will not pass their throats, which implies that their faith is shallow and skin-deep (Ibid); (5) They will be extremists in religious matters (Abu Ya'la & al-Razzaq); (6) They shall quote the Qur'an believing it is for them although in reality it is against them (Sahih Muslim & Bukhari, Abu Dawood, al-Tabari, al-Asqalani); (7) They will be extremely oppressive, bloodthirsty and violent (Abu Dawood); (8) They will be the most evil of the creation (Sahih Muslim); (9) They will shed blood that is inviolable-the blood of humankind/civilians (Sahih Bukhari & Muslim, al-Hakim) and; (10) They would be made the dogs of Hell [in the Hereafter] (al-Tirmidhi). ISIS or ISIL or IS or any other group that has an ideology of murdering humankind is categorically outside the fold of Islam. They have no connection with Al-Qur'an nor with the seerat [teachings] of Mustafa/Muhammad (SAW). This has been declared by the classical and authentic scholars, ranging from al-Bukhari to al-Tabari to al-Arabi to al-Qurtubi to Ibn Taymiyya to al-Subki to al-Ghazali inter alia.	0

Right?

Sick to the back teeth of the migrant crisis..I'm pleased they've closed the borders, but they will find a way to get here!! Isn't it about time they got the message and went back home.

You can't rely on the polls at all in my opinion because they don't represent everyone who gets to vote. They ask a group of people so that is not at all as reliable as the actual election result. I don't vote FI and I'm not against women in any way, I think everyone should have the same rights. Men, women, immigrants, the elderly and so on but I don't see the relevance of that in this discussion. This is also usually the case in between elections. Parties that are in opposition almost always go up in the polls because of disappointment with the ruling government. Of course people are disappointed today but that doesn't mean they sympathize with right wing extremists.	0
My parents were Anglo Indians who came here in the fifties a few years after Indian Independence ....they thought the terraced houses of the East End were warehouses or factories as they passed them on the train. But they made a life here. My concern is the large number of single young males gathered in France rushing moving vehicles. Their expectations of UK are unrealistic l should imagine. These are men and boys who have made the journey without family from conflict areas to the promised land. Its not a recipe for success for any side of the argument.	1
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, you stupid people, a veil does not imply Islamic faith, and neither does a headscarf or head covering. It's a matter of personal choice. If you see the Queen wearing a headscarf, do you think she must have become a follower of Islam? No. So stop being disingenuous.	1

Why is BBC not calling these people for what they are? From the moment that they stepped on Greek shores they were safe and once decided that they wanted to move on they became economic refugees. Asylum is given to people who are in danger. These people are calculating where to get most benefits and where they can therefore cause the most damage to a welfare state.	1
When people use the word racism I shake my head, why expose yourself so easily? What has this got to do with racism. Why always throw the blame card, guess it is the easy way out of your own responsibility. Regardless of their situation. Is it now suddenly justifiable to pick and choose a country for them?? Defy the laws that are currently in place. So, just because I am a refugee (in hordes) I walk into the country with the best benefits and they must accept me? What has this got to do with racism? Can I walk over the border of a country and say, hey, its the Americans fault, I am a refugee, do what I say and what I want?	1
SD, The so called Sweden democrats is still a minority. But yes, we have problems to provide roof over the refugees heads for the moment, and winter is coming, its cold, dark and soon the snow is falling. Far from a paradise ... We have problems because we have already been taking a huge responsibility for many years, for the refugees from Irak, Somalia, Afghanistan...

Personally, I agree with those who view multiculturalism as Anathema to a Nation State System. Whoever governs a Nation must impose their values on the whole. Today, Obama imposes his cultural /philosophical mindset on all Americans. Any new leader will do likewise. The ONLY way that multiculturalism can work is if people choose Kingdom Economics. My model eliminates all human rulers. All human Government is abolished. If people desire multiculturalism, they need to rethink their philosophy of government. As of today, I understand why the Swedish Democrats desire a policy of less immigration. Think about Kingdom Economics, if you seriously desire a multicultural society. D	0

Not ok you have an EU passport, letting in Rapists and Killers from all over Europe. Why are we paying to Secure Frances borders to the UK? If they get on a bloody Ferry they need arresting and putting back on the next Ferry. France should then be fined ¬£2000 for each one. Punishment for not doing their own bloody Job.

A difficult concept for most people to understand is that - unless you are an asylum seeker, coming from the atrocities of war, which apparently many people lack any empathy to be able to understand, and in which case ANY country should grant you hospitality and support - those of us who come from EU (and parts of Asia, Africa, America, etc., from those areas not affected by extreme poverty and war), so in most cases not from starvation, come here to achieve excellence, to study, to build businesses, because UK is a country that rightly supports small businesses, a creative country in which education is valued. We want to create opportunities for others as well. We don't come to steal. We don't leave family and friends and a familiar home to be on benefits. That would hardly repay what we miss. If I have to be poor here I may as well be poor with my own family If some of us are on benefits it's because of an emergency situation (like it should be for everyone - it shouldn't be lifestyle - in theory), but aspiring to be out of it as soon as possible. Aspiring to earn and pay taxes. Aspiring to make British friends and give what we can.	0

"Here are some thoughts from the Croatian perspective regarding the ongoing migration situation. In short and simple words, the problem derives from the following assumptions: 1. Migrants are fleeing from the ISIS and middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece without being checked; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel, as at the time Germany saw a chance to seek cheep labor force; 4. Hungary erects walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece or Turkey. Were they registered in Greece? No! They either stayed in Turkey (circa 1.8 Mil) or moved forward to Europe. There is nowhere in the EU or international law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. Number of refugees heading for Germany exceeds German needs, so it is possible that they will no longer be welcomed in Germany. This means that they will stuck in Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia, waiting to be properly registered and transported to other countries (e.g. USA and Canada offered no more than 130.000 places). At this point it is clear that all countries en route to Germany are not conforming with the international law requirements. The only way for Croatia to deal with the situation is by simply transferring them as soon as possible to the end destination. Unlike Hungary, Croatia does that humane. Well done Mr Milanovic. Last and most important - this migration problem cannot be handled by one country by itself. The problem needs to be resolved politically within the NATO, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS. With the emphasis on ""full scale"" and ""military"". Bottom line is - all countries must cooperate and stop blaming each other or the US. We all have the same problem; we need to assemble and start taking actions against ISIS and terrorism."	0

And here we are, i voted S(socialist party) btw, having to lend money to pay for the cake. Who is gonna have to work extra years for that. The healthcare just issued a red alert on itself for patientsecurity. The elders, whom most payed more tax then we do, are robbed on their state pensions. Its a fact, the glass is more then full. I want to help as many as possible, but taking in more then you can care for isnt helping anyone. In fact, everyone crying for open borders should offer their extra space and pay for it themselves. I could probably house 4-5 ppl, but I would not be able to afford it, so I wont. Guess that makes me rascist, funny thing. Because I don't see anyone else with open doors! Rapecapital of the world, media admitted to have been told to darken reports of anything related to immigrants for years. Criminality higher then ever, social structure collapsing. I like to make a comparison. If you let someone into your house and offer a bed and food, arent you expecting your new guest to be thankfull, respectfull and living to your rules? Fucking leftside shamers thinking everything is moral, go down to the border and bring as many as you can home, that would be the humane thing! But thats not the same thing, bring ppl here, just not near you, hypocrits	1

You also have to remember Kotaiba, we are living on oil money. Oil money that will run out. People seem to forget that we don't have a viable backup plan if our funds get depleted. We are supposed to save up money so we can live a few years after the oil runs out. Maybe even find a plan B backed up by that fund. We are not directly part of the EU, but we signed a deal so we could get imported food easier. That signing includes giving money to countries like Greece and Spain. Sure we have money now, but if we spend it all on the refugees (which also costs money because of welfare, housing and food) then we are basically ruining our future. And now with the oil pricing dropping... Norway might be one of the richest countries in the world but we are saving our money untill the time comes when we don't have oil. Note: I said big cities don't have space, and i live in a pretty remote and small area. The immigrants and refugees who live here are complaining about it being too remote :(	0

I agree Craig McIntosh we have the same issue in Sweden, the problem is people dont like change, or strange things, or having to share. Many people also lack understanding, arent well traveled and hence immigration becomes this big evil that has to be stopped, and we throw these light fashist parties at the immigration to make the big bad thing go away. Even if imigration cant bet stopped, many countries have immigration to thank for what they are, even my country sweden during its prime in the 1600-1800 was built upp thx to foreigners, merchants from all over the world, craftsmen etc and others. I can agree that in many western countries the process of making a new arrived person blend into society painless isnt always working that well. Do we really need right wing extreme parties to solve that. It illustrates the need to education of people, politicians that are prepared to deal with issues, but also to work towards a society that is moore tolerant. Because the world today is in a period of change, much of the old order in the middle east and north africa are carving itself up. We have problems with more hostile neighbours in the east and people are emigrating in numbers not seen since ww2. Some people are also so fast to put numbers on other human beings, and this worries me, they would not do this towards one of its own, no matter what crimes or acts of evil they did, but an immigrant oh lord do they cost two bags of potatoes every month or will we taxpayers have to pay the ammounts of a lamborghini? It rubbs me the wrong way, and distract from the core issues with foreign policy, integration and the likes. Some have a tendency put even moore blame on the victims and its very dontraproductive to solve issues with imigration to begin with.	0

Why are they still calling them migrants ? Someone trying to break into your home you would not call a visitor would you ? You'd call them a criminal. Someone trying to cross into your country illegally is not a migrant. These people were refugees when they landed in Greece or Italy. Possibly fleeing a war zone and possibly just trying to get to a better country for their own interests. If they decide to leave these two lands (which aren't at war or persecuting them) because benefits are better in other countries they then become illegal immigrants. Here we see the folly of open door ideals.	1

Is it that Germans wants to turn Europe upside down again every 100 years? Angela Merkel by saying germany will accept eveybody who will come, even unregistered, without discussing this with neighbouring countries and fellow europeans, broke all possible rules and laws that are here in Europe regarding asylum seekers process and putting so much pressure on other countries who could not be prepared. What now? I do not like the media shaming Hungary to be honest with you, I do not like any form of violence, but hey, they are really just trying to follow the rules and laws in place and very much respect Austria as they did not want just to allow the people to invade their neighbours. Then they gave up. But now Germany closes borders? Seriously?! Asylum seekers process applies for all from all around the world, but not for people from middle east or what?!	1
They have the numbers now at the borders. All they need now are weapons and an ambitious commander. Just imagine what would happen when that number of people decide to declare war on Europe.

In Sweden a rape is not only rape by a penis penetrating a vagina by force! It is using anything penetrating by force! That is why it seems we got a high rate! Also us Swedish women are also prone to go to the police to get rapists done more than any other countries women as we get told from a very young age that we should always report! We have come very far with that thank God as a lot of other countries have not! I am proud to be Swedish and value the democracy and the modern soceity we have!

Firstly, you should acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have made, despite being far less wealthy than Europe or the oil-rich Gulf countries. Secondly, if you are going to criticize Saudi Arabia and Co, you should also have the intellectual honesty to then also slam the only other democracy in the region as well, namely Israel. Israel has taken in exactly ZERO refugees from any country, including non-Muslim black Africans. These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are morons. Seriously? -_- Let me get this straight, you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property? Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter. The Gulf States on the other hand are ruled by Sunnis, some having Shia minorities. And finally, some Syrians are in fact moving to Saudi Arabia in secret, provided they have plenty of money (I know this for a fact)."	1

This is just another Liberalism gone mental report. I live in Sweden and know many Swedes who talk to foreigners. I also know many girls from the middle east here who date Swedish guys (but have to in secret), because if their fathers knew they were seeing Swedish boys they could be either injured or killed. Yet this report says Swedes won't mix and integrate. Almost all torching of mosques have been committed by Syrian Christians as they hate muslims even more because of what ISIS has done in Syria. The youth from Trollh√§tten was crazy and was not active in the SD's, the woman who was murdered at Ikea by an immigrant who was told to leave Sweden had very little reporting, shame on the Swedish press there.

I would argue here that refugees are refusing their given remote houses for one reason, they want to work and not to live on well-fare system. Therefore they believe living in a remote house would not help them to find a work where they can be independent. I can say that clearly as I work closely with refugees. as you see, those guys want to give to the country not to take. You argue that those refugees are handicaps who will live on Norway funds for good and that is absolutely wrong. Many of my Norwegians friends I met have not understood that new immigrants/refugees are new resources and new opportunities to Norway, NOT a cost!	0

Personally, I think it's a good thing. Look back to how the Establishment has used & abused children & covered it up, for decades - more than a century in fact. Look at how the churches have shuffled abusers around the country, instead of dealing with them. There are so many examples of how things are changing for the better, not just through immigration, but the increased flow of information that comes with the digital age... Pick and choose who the economic migrants are, and we can still take in the enemies of other states. They have been very useful over the centuries..."	0

I tried to get some statistics on migrants in UK but could not. A Danish friend supplied me with some for Denmark who have taken in a lot of Syrian and Muslims for some time. in their first year 29% of asylum seekers committed a crime. 34.5% of rapes are committed by Muslims despite only making up 4% of the population. 28% of prison inmates are Muslim. After 3 years 87% of Syrians are still unemployed. More than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Somalis have an unemployment rate of over 80%. I think this may point to just how grateful these people are to the country's taking them in and what a great contribution they make to the host countries. Do we really want more of this.	1

"I am happy that the idiocy of my country that is the Sweden Democrats has been brought up as international news and all, but you can't use the UK as an example that ""mixing traditions"" does work, since the UK is pretty damn known for having exceptions in EU rules stating the least amount of refugees and sim. you must take into your countries. Getting away from that issue, it's pretty funny how you use the youth association of SD(SDU) as examples of showing how immature SD's members are. Since they are youth they are naturally more immature, but from experience, truth is they don't mature any farther than that so it's quite the fitting picture. Overall I believe this is well made and really important to show not only the citizens of Sweden, but the rest of the world as well. Hopefully some voters of SD will watch this and realise what party they are actually voting for."	1

Muslims must realise that Islam is a danger to this world. They should do some introspection, stop attending religious gatherings, get rid of their herd mentality and regard themselves human first. They should realise that Islam is a disease, a Ponzi scheme. Spreading Islam is not good. They are running away from this disease, they should stop its spreading. They should cure themselves from this disease and be a part of this peaceful and civilised modern world. There is no god, there is no afterlife.	1
Or it could be so called muslims Shias . And they are capable of doing anything in the name of our peaceful religion. God will deal with the .	0

All this story in this report is very heart rendering until I read the last part - trying to get to Germany or Sweden - what about all the other Arabic and Islamic countries and all the countries in between? This sacrifice is not about safety any more it's about going to a country to find a better life FOR FREE and AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS who already live in that country as has their generations of family and continually paid in to it, without trying to fight for their own. Of course losing children and any other part of the family is an horrendous thing, but that's where my pity ends and I have no sympathy apart from that.	1

"Cynical shitheads like SD and SDU and it's followers, are just scared of a threat that they themselves will create if they keep spouting shit like this.

Because old timers are still hateful, youngsters become scared and suspicious about everything that the party is, which is all bullshit lies that they themselves create to become true. So...if you retards could just STOP burning their only homes they have, stop spouting stupid shit like ""filthy Romans"" (and GOD how angry I became when I heard the little rat say that), and just welcome everyone in your hearts, you will see the goodness and helpfulness in every single human being on this planet.

No body call US as a big brother without any reason . US is the reason for many countries to be safe. Including Japan, South Korea, India, Philippine. USA has made mistakes in the past but they work on it ( and I know they are still doing mistakes). I feel Putin is using everything for his political benefit. Rubel has fallen so low and the economic crisis made Russia desperate. So when he started bombing in Syria he bombed anti Assad forces in the name of ISIS. Still his major bombing is against them. But after the aircraft was bombed he is bombing some parts of Raqqua but that's not his main target. Putin is trying to install confidence in Russians. It's pure politics.	0

Deliberately ignoring refugees to allow spread of Islam in West: Saudi official ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre letting them go to Europe, isn‚Äôt that enough?‚Äô ‚ÄúWe are ignoring the issue as a strategic maneuver. If these refugees go and settle in the west then they will take the beacon of light i.e. Islam, with them,‚Äù an official from the Saudi government said. ‚ÄúWhat we are doing is waiting for them to set up camp so that they can show these infidel nations how to save themselves from kufr,‚Äù he said. The current plan seems to be to let the refugees find homes in Europe and then wait to see what happens. ‚ÄúWe already have a lot of Muslims here‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt need any more. We could give those white people some refuge if they wanted though,‚Äù the official said and laughed. Syrians have an exceptionally hard time migrating to Arab countries and are often denied entrance to begin with. ‚ÄúLook let us be honest it‚Äôs like asking a Muslim man to let a Hindu into their homes. We‚Äôre letting them go to Europe, isn‚Äôt that enough?‚Äù the official asked. ‚ÄúEven if we did let them in where would they live? It‚Äôs all sand here. At least they‚Äôve got water where they are right now,‚Äù the official said and laughed again. Akhtar Al Hassani, an activist from the USA: ‚ÄúIslam is meant to take over the world,‚Äù he said, and added: ‚ÄúThe Arab world will never let the refugees in so they have to go elsewhere.‚Äù Saudi Arab has released similar statements. Some Muslim countries have decided to block apps like snapchat, candy crush saga and temple run in protest of EU migration policy. ‚ÄúEurope can really learn a thing or two from the hijrat-e-Madina,‚Äù Hassani said of the crisis. Meanwhile, the reaction from Saudi Arabia has been lauded by many Muslim countries as being highly appropriate and on point. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt take any refugees because‚Ä¶ errr we have this thing going on,‚Äù a statement from the country said. ‚ÄúWe are working on ensuring we don‚Äôt create too many refugees out of the Yemen war. Is that not enough?‚Äù the statement questioned in closing. It remains to be seen whether this outrage from the Muslim Ummah will result in building the kind of pressure that is needed to help resolve the refugee issue. Imam, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem: ‚ÄúEurope has become old and decrepit and needs human reinforcement‚Ä¶.they are not motivated by compassion for the Levant, its people and its refugees,‚Äù said Ayed, adding, ‚ÄúSoon, we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.‚Äù ‚ÄúThroughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused with hatred toward Muslims. They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility, so they look for fertility in our midst,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe will give them fertility! We will breed children with them, because we shall conquer their countries!‚Äù Ayed stated that ‚Äúwhether you like it or not,‚Äù Americans, Italians, Germans and the French will be forced to take the ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe shall soon collect them in the name of the coming Caliphate. We will say to you: these are our sons. Send them, or we will send our armies to you,‚Äù concluded Ayed. Ayed correctly outlines the fact that Europe is facing demographic disaster because its citizens have stopped having children. Italy‚Äôs current birth rate of 8.4 per 1,000 people is the lowest since 1861 and the picture is much the same across the rest of Europe, where population is only increasing as a result of mass immigration. Birth rates in the west are far lower than those in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most of the migrants are coming from. The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, ‚ÄúAnd whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.‚Äù ‚ÄúTo emigrate in the cause of Allah ‚Äì that is, to move to a new land in order to bring Islam there, is considered in Islam to be a highly meritorious act,‚Äù Khabaristan Times KHABARISTANTIMES.COM	1
Anna many pakistani women dont wear pakistan is not west and dont think west is free you are slaves of oil and money	1
I will also qualify my previous comment: it is appropriate for Christian women who are involved in outreach missions to Muslims in their own culture in the middle east to wear the hijab. However this is not that culture and so lends to confusion and in my opinion is a pr/PC gesture. If she really wants to show solidarity how about for the Christian girls raped by Muslim terrorists? But that wont get media coverage.	1

They didn't say this news bureau gets X amount of seats, they said ""These journalists can come"". Those journalists happened to be the ones who had been the least critical of them.

The 'Open borders' policy in the EU zone without a common minimum wage, unified taxation arrangements and a common welfare safety net has been a complete political, economic and social disaster. No better examples are that the EU zone is still in recession after 7 years, extremist parties are gaining political ground and unemployment is in double digits Employers and multinational companies on the other hand have a large pool of cheap labour, and can move capital accross borders and offshore, so all good then...	0

90% are just invading economic refugees, why flood your country with third world Muslim immigrants who won't work, won't learn Swedish and bring their Islamic sharia law and jihad with them! They don't respect women or any one else way of life! Now why would you want that for your country you politically correct marxist moron! all cultures are not equal, ours is superior to theirs, it is what it is, why else do they all want to come to Europe? Because we are better and have welfare, yet they won't go to Saudi Arabia or UAE or other wealthy Muslim countries..... For two reasons: they have no welfare because they are MUSLIM, two, they want to invade all non Muslim lands and spread islam every where! Before you decide to call me RACIST, remember Islam and muslims are NOT a race!	1

I am ashamed of these people. I'm ashamed of the whole world in fact. Sweden has been taking a lot of refugees that is a fact. Sadly many European countries hasn't.what Europe do forget is that those we against them attitude will lure make Isis people able to lure weak people with nowhere to go to have an excuse to join them and maybe even fly bomb every fucklng country. As long as we contribute to wars and unfairness we are responsible to what happens in the world. Sad but true people. We can't run and hide any more. We need to unite. There is always ways but so many people is so not ready to change their perfect life. It's about humanity not race or anything here. In a few years time Africa will follow. And we will ask. Why the hell. I ask why the hell not? This world is unfair and we are all to Blame. Sad but true Also I see many good ones in the world and now when Christmas is coming closer. I hope you think about this? Whether you believe in Christ or not. Would he want you to celebrate him? He was in many aspects a refugee preaching. He was a man from Nazareth and Bethlehem. Many refugees are from that area too. And he took in everyone. He even preached for his enemies. I don't necessarily believe in God or Jesus myself but really we are all are eager to spend millions on our loved ones while people out there try to come to us after maybe Years with wars. Stuff most of Europeans can't imagine. I think he would rather say. And you lot complains these persons cost money but you spend 10000 of money on Christmas gifts how is that to celebrate me? He would shake his head for how stupid this world is. I believe in humanity.	0

"I'm guessing you haven't actually read any of my comments. Not one of us is dismissing the statistics. I'll humour you with a few excerpts from the Wikipedia page to which you're referring: ""However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult, which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures."" ""The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports."" ""Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases."" ""According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence. This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships, may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality."" tl;dr: Learn a little about data interpretation, don't reach conclusions based purely on assumptions, and always, always read texts/Wikipedia pages (at least the parts related to the subject of discussion) in their entirety; especially if you're using them as references to back up your claims."	0

"that's true but rroma (""gypsies"") are becoming more and more educated and integrated into Romanian society (as well as in other countries). And you can see that this applies to anyone who receives the proper education, regardless of background, skin colour, etc. Being raised in the proper environment where they can develop a motivation for learning is important. The problem is more to do with the fact that a great deal of rroma/gypsies are conservative themselves and want their traditions preserved.. which unfortunately and truthfully, is only hurting those who want to learn and improve their situation in life. Though it's true a lot of Romanians have put gypsies down because of their reputation for being criminals, which doesn't help the (potentially) good ones change their situation either."	0

If you are a true Christian stick to your own faith. No Muslim woman will thank you for wearing a Habib. By wearing it you are signalling that it's ok to be downtrodden, oppressed, in some places not allowed out unless with a male(family) not allowed education etc.Where will you find a Muslim woman who will take off the Habib and wear ordinary clothes with a cross around their necks( I doubt you will find it anywhere) so lady think again.

Jorge E. Supertramp- are you capable of debating without insulting and name calling? My mindset is far from prehistoric. I have lived in Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. I am all for equality, I support everyone's right to freedom of speech, religion, access to education, good health care and a good quality of life. These men that are being shown on every News Feed are not examples of what Islam is all about. I do not condone their actions and/ or their behaviour, far from it. They are doing an injustice to their religion and the people who actually need the help and will now be refused. I am sick of the bashing, the insults...we are all humans. Why do they have to change their religion and how does them practicing their faith, affect you? Are they forcing you to convert? Are they making you pray five times a day? Are they making you dress different from what you would normally dress? You are repeating only what you have heard others, on social media, say. Perhaps, try getting to know a person who practices Islam, and then comment.	0

i work in Norway my friend, so i can argue a bit about Norwegian resources and space. It's not a matter of resources or space. It's a matter of acceptance. With all love to my beloved Norwegians but it's the time for Europe to stand on itself and stop wars and prevent it from happening instead of being puppets to the US . EUROPEANs should just forget their colonial history and start acting as responsibles. I'm aware that Norway is not part of EU but I'm arguing about the general situation in EU.	0

"People in the western world are getting smart, as they have started to wake up to the fact that their leaders have lied to them about Islam being a peaceful religion. This is from the so called religion of Peace and Love. This is directly from the Koran, it's all about intolerance and Conquest, there is no love and (peace) in the Koran. Koran 2:191 ""Slay the unbelievers whenever you find them."" Koran 3:28 ""Muslims must not take the infidels as friends."" Koran 3:85 ""Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable."" Koran 5:33 ""Maim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam"". Koran 8:12 ""Terrorize and behead those that believe in scriptures other than the Koran."" Koran 8:60 ""Muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels."" Koran 8:65 ""The unbelievers are stupid; urge all muslims to fight them."" Koran 9:5 ""When opportunity arises kill the infidels wherever you find them."" Koran 9:30 ""The Jews and Christians are perverts, fight them.""

For years the British people have had immigration and migration forced down our throats without any consultation by the political elite or democratic say on the matters! Labour love immigration and migration and will encourage more of the same as we have seen in the previous disaster of their term at No10, besides they see this as more numbskulls that will vote for them. The Conservatives have failed to stop or curb immigration and migration as they have just become new Labour and are riddled with pro-EU Liberals, also all three parties know that this helps keep wages at a certain level. You can only ignore the genuine concerns of the British people for so long, the backlash of the disenfranchised people of this country is long over due!

Hypocrite? Why don't you guys listen to the unheard voices? You're the hypocrite deceived by communists lies just like before the wwii. War crimes? The ones decided by the countries that bombed here on a daily basis and nuked here twice? Have you heard of Tokyo trials because that's what all the participant nations as judges opposed to the idea of yet the result of it is widely known as the past today which you need to learn what really happened there. Also the annexation of Korea was koreas idea and we refused. Yet they wouldn't listen and assassinated Hirofumi Ito as he was in charge of the decision and he was against it. Don't you think it's weird Koreans think the murderer is their hero? They forced us to work on the annexation so we spent twice as much as their annual budget. Also during the annexation, we treat Koreans the same. No one was forced by the Japanese government and we have a lot of official documents and newspaper articles proving the point. Comfort women, the majority of them were Japanese and there were Korean ones but they were paid more than high ranked soldiers. With that they could build 20 houses per year. We also have that proof as well because of the bank. In 1944 America caught comfort women and on their official documents it says there nothing more than prostitutes. I can keep denying the stupid propaganda but it's not my place because that's what the world needs to learn instead of swallowing the info they see. SO stupid and very hypocritical of all of you.	1

Then do you think the the powers to be then in power today they wouldn't put up with this shit. A fascist race allowing migrants in I think we're very lucky. Plus making a video with an agenda isn't journalism its Facebook trash social media cock gobbling. This video should have showed both sides because both sides has a story to tell.	1

Ans as far as ""Americans"" creating the problem, are you kidding? The middle east has been fighting the same ridiculous holy wars since the beginning of time. Did the governments including the UK create some of the issues concerning Isis absolutely. But are you all really so incredibly stupid to think that the average American who lives and works and has absolutely no political influence had anything to do with international relations or foreign affairs? Everybody's always picking on the Americans until they want something. This is in fact an invasion and how does it fall under the tag of invasion well the fact that they're literally just walking over other people to push their way into countries into which they do not live or have citizenship refusing to follow any of the laws and rules concerning gaining temporary and or permanent citizenship and are demanding to have the people who are actually citizens pushed over for their betterment. Starving people terrified people don't throw food water supplies and bite the hand that feed them they take the help they do what they can to get what they need for their families and they follow the rules. It's incredibly ignorant to pretend that these people are victims when they're blowing down walls police guards military and other citizens in order to take what they want and gain what they want."	1

Just the same bullshit we have to deal with in Germany right now -.- This guys tries to argue without arguments. For example some in germany claim Islam would be the problem, it would be a violant religion however we have from 1990-2015 over 130 confirmed murder with raccist background and the dark figure of crime is over 800 ... In the past 25 years radical germans killed more than migrants did. Ok how about act of violence ... as it turns out migrant boys arround 14-22 behave just like any other ... and if something happened it's primarily attributed to problems in the socialsystem ... Those people just rely on populism.	0

No, they aren't your 'sisters'. Dothey believe that Jesus is the Savior or the world as the Bible teaches? They the Muslims, don't the Jewish ppl don't etc? Then they are in NO WAY 'sisters' of yours since they are of another spirit. God even. And they are technically 'anti0christ'. Do you think Jesus is calling anti christ 'brother or sister' or 'saved'? No, he is not. But they, the anti christ/s' are always welcome to repent and come to an accurate understanding of Jesus and 'be saved' and become 'sisters' and for men 'brothers' in Christ. Thank you.	0

The empire did do some good things; however it also spread lots of evil throughout the world. Reimagined and spread slavery, created racism for one. The omission that the wealth of the world has been concentrated in western Europe and North America from past and continuing atrocities is not surprising.

Ridiculous !the policy of the UK has not encouraged people to risk their lives! It has saved lives .It will also not give more help to Syrians who can afford smugglers,but instead to,those of the 4 million living in camps who are most vulnerable .When has the policy of the survival of the fittest being the right way ! Germany only gave half of what the UK does to assist the camps Why ?Germany needs to recruit workers using mass immigration .Refugees in camps are no use to them .The UK policy of giving adequate support to the camps will ultimately be seen as the only humane way to deal with this crisis .be proud of your country !As The Pope and the Dalai Lama pointed out Europe can not take all the refugees from Syria and other countries .	0

Fortunately, they do not represent anything close to a majority in Sweden."	1
I have no problem with EU immigration. Indeed, I love it. Have many European friends and loved ones. Indeed, I find that European immigrants to the UK integrate far more than British expats do in Spain, and all the European people I know have AT LEAST three languages. Immigration from places with cultural aspects that are in direct and hostile contrast to 'ours', who do not integrate, and sometimes actively seek to destabilise or slag off the country they bladdy chose to come to? No,I don't love that so much.	1

Actually seb, I have a massive problem with the eu. Even if you take all of the free movement issues, 75% of our laws made there, being presented with additional ad hoc bills for 1.7 billion pounds so we can help fund the french and German economies etc etc. Even if you take all of that out of the equation, there is still the anti democratic agenda on the plate. The commission are appointed not elected. They cannot be voted out or removed. The commission are the only ones who can propose or change legislation. The president, who nobody seems to know, is not elected, by the people, although meps do get to have a vote on him by way of secret ballot, ,,, and there is only one nominee. Many referenda from member states have been ignored, I could go on, but I think I've made my point.	0

While racism is wrong , I can understand countries and nations with big & old history and culture such as Sweden have every right to preserve their own race, culture , history , traditions , language , democracy and so on ! They are not like the United States, Canada and other American continent countries (countries of immigrants that they stole from the original American Indians). Nor they are like the current or older colonists like U.K, France and etc. that have the responsibility to take in immigrants in from all those countries they previously colonized or those countries they have destroyed in middle east and Africa during their past or recent invasions and occupations that have left those countries ruined and their people running away as immigrants and refugees all over the world... Old countries and nations like Sweden, Norway , Finland, Hungry and etc. don't have to pay the ultimate price of getting their own respective countries ruined by immigrants that have no desire to assimilate into their cultures and people due to so many different reasons... These countries have every right to preserve their true national identities and way of life without being called racists and being condemned for it by immigrants and others in other countries. At the same time, they have to change their immigration laws accordingly and treat those immigrants they already let in with dignity and according to the rules of law!	1

Yet nobody seems to be thinking across those lines, particularly not our governments!! What happened to that young child is terrible, a tragedy.....but do we want more dead children in the UK at the hands of terrorists ?? ......NO!!!!!!......We could avoid more innocent deaths on either side, if Saudi Arabia opened its doors to these people.	1

basically times are hard and when they are people look to blame others. the people they should be blaming are the ones who are in charge. the ones that said give up your rights to us and the corporations because of trickle down economics. Basically we will make it easier to sack people therefore companies will be more likely to hire, but that didn't happen, all that happened was it was made easier for people to be sacked. did the wealth trickle down as promised? no of course not, that will never happen. People with money and power above all else desire...more money and power. this was a lie from the start and here we are blaming immigrants for the lies and falsehoods perpetuated by the elite, rich ruling classes. its not the fault of immigrants that there are no jobs. The jobs these people are taking are the ones British people simply don't want. Perfect example, I have a friend who wont take work because it is not what he wants to do, despite the fact its more money than benefits. I have a girl who has a chemistry degree who is from Nigeria who comes to clean my apartment. she is here working her socks off through a cleaning agency to pay for her degree. A woman far smarter than I. I cant see a British person doing that. It would be beneath them.

"ummmm Key Findings There were 698,512 live births in England and Wales in 2013, a decrease of 4.3% from 729,674 in 2012. In 2013, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) decreased to 1.85 children per woman, from 1.94 in 2012. In 2013 the stillbirth rate fell to 4.7 per thousand total births, from 4.9 in 2012. The average age of mothers in 2013 increased to 30.0 years, compared with 29.8 years in 2012. Over a quarter (26.5%) of live births were to mothers born outside the UK; a small increase compared with 25.9% in 2012. Get all the tables for this publication in the data section of this publication . http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2013/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2013.html But i understand you got that information from the DailyMail article published around the same time. Furthermore, Latest figures from the ONS show there are now 521,000 Polish-born residents of the UK - up from 75,000 in 2003. It makes the Poles the biggest UK community by foreign nationality - and the second (after India) by country of birth. The figures came out as part of the comprehensive annual population survey, which (at least until the census results emerge next year) give us a real insight in the demographics of Britain. http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/26/foreign-born-uk-population Another source more recently and academic as well that backs up those numbers. That the highest foreign national births in the UK belong to India then Poland , followed by Pakistan and third, fourth and fifth is also occupied by EU member states. http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migrants-uk-overview I propose to you sir based on your comnent that you are a bigot on the basis that you have an issue that apparently children being born in the UK belong to ""foreigners"" I.e. none whites so yeah it is prejudicial and has no room in our society. Just saying.... Also before you jump down my throat I don't care I am just proving you wrong. I also think dehumanising refugees or migrants is a great show of barbarism and lack of humanity."	0

Secondly, some women wear hijab not only as a form of modesty but also to show their identity. They wear it because it's what they are used to & simply because they want to. The fact they ""adorn"" their face with makeup as Mario states just proves that they wear the hijab out of choice as surely someone who is forced to wear it would not be allowed to wear makeup. The fact that Mario points that he has seen so many women with hijab and makeup just proves that hijab is not something that is forced upon Muslim women as suggested or perceived by the western world."	0

Most of us will, beyond a doubt, have Roman, Viking, Dane, Norman, Jewish or Anglo-Saxon ancestry. So, what's the problem? The fact is migrants are by and large the easy scapegoats for our collective problems. We need to move away from the blame game and recognise what is really going on.	0
Maybe the countries I've visited, lived & worked are different to your 70. They might want to live in Britain but not because we are all friendly, happy, inviting & accepting people. More often it's all about the money.	0

are you supposed to be educated?Cant you see what the rest of the world can see beheadings,genocide and massacre of millions of non moslems worldwide,killing of homosexuals,buring women and children alive,rape of children and mutilation,burning ppl head first,hangings,stonings this is islam where is the love and peace you talk of?Islam is a cult wayne you are brainwashed to believe what they want you to for now,islam dictates they do and say whatever it takes to achieve islam jihad if that means lying to a kuffar so be it,islam strategy is lies,deceit,propoganda and contradicitons.Islam dictates all moslems do islam jihad all moslems believe the same vile ideology of convert or be killed,all moslems have the same evil agenda stop lying and being so bloody naive,read the Koran its all there you must have the edited edition,kill the kuffar,kill the infidels,kill the apostates kill the jews,kill the christians kill the non believers oh yeh so loving and peaceful NOT!.they are doing it worldwide and burning christian churches rapng yezidi women and children you claim to ignorant of all of this where the hell are you on another planet?no one could be so ignorant and naive or lying,you could be another fake moslem profile defending your satan worshiping cult,when moslems defend islam evil they lie and say if we killed an innocent it would be as though we had killed all mankind they can say this because they do not regard human beings as innocent if your a non believer they can kill you it wont matter,they despise you,this is the lies and contradicitons,The peace they talk of is the peace there will be when they have killed all non believers all of humanity,so evil and brainwashed they think of nothing of killing human beings wayne are you sub human like all moslems who want to kill all humanity?they insult the bible because it annoys them God is the one true alighty God they dont have one,only a false self proclaimed prophet,and the bible is the true world of god and the church is the house of god this is why moslems blaspheme and commit sacrilege against Gods house,they will burn in Hell for this blasphemy	1
"I think these people would feel lost without their ""cause"", without the presence of foreigners who are actually sustaining their pride, their ""superiority"", their fight. they look empty-headed to me, intoxicated by FILTHY tabloid newspapers, incapable of giving any better arguments than ""we want sweden as it was before"". well, guess what, romania is also not the same anymore, and that's because you are voraciously chopping it's forests down. and that's just an example of how the rich countries are rich and the poor are poor. nobody likes leaving his or her country in search for a better place to live, and there's a lot of suffering involved in this. the world belongs to everybody, and it's such a shame that in 2015 you can still find young people, especially well educated ones, thinking in old, racist, territorial ways. unlike these poor migrants you still have your families and friends around, be thankful for that and think about better ways to deal with the migration problem!"	1

"The complexity of this issue- who benefits, who loses from mass immigration into the UK- is almost never rationally and dispassionately debated. We are up against human nature. Having made up our minds-largely based upon emotion- we look for evidence to support our view. And we dismiss evidence that points the other way. As posts here indicate we are all of us always ""patrolling the boundaries of the normal"" (a phrase that I read somewhere that fits) and looking to exclude someone from our good graces. This issue touches on people's deepest instincts and upon their sense of their identify and for many (righty or wrongly) it's felt as an attack upon their ability to earn a wage. My instinct is that immigration brings a net benefit- in a variety of ways- but I recognise that there are costs, too. And as a salaried and housed middle class man I don't pay those costs. Both sides in this argument must desist from name-calling and look to debate the evidence rationally"	0

Nova, what you find offensive is just the norm for the women here. What you find offensive maybe what is comfort and ease for the women here. Things were not like this in the 70s, different eras bring about different rules. I am sure in years to come there will be change once again-no one can say for sure. I have seen doctors/nurses (female) just wear the white coats-no abayas. The abaya aspect is more of conforming aspect as Scott has suggested-for the ones that take it off when abroad. There are cities that are more strict and ones that are less. There are women who wear hijab for modesty or the ones who wear it with makeup out of their own choice because their perception is what it is. It's not one strict rule. That's what I'm trying to say.	0

There's always a limit for how many immigrants a country can take in during a finite period of time and still sustain a stable welfare system. As a Social Democrat in Sweden, I'm sad to say that this limit has been reached. People should not be forced to live in tent camps during the winter because we can't take proper care of them when they arrive. It's time that other EU countries take their responsibility. So please don't portray us Swedes as racist scums. Most of us want to help, but in reality we don't have unlimited resources.	0

My friend. Islam is Supremacist /Domination Philosophy. If you learn the history, you will learn this. In this case, they are not using war or violence to dominate Europe. They are using our own values and laws against us. Misplaced compassion, political correctness, freedom of religion and human rights have allowed them to get a foothold in the land and eventually help them turn all of Europe in a Muslim caliphate. They will use democracy and forcing government concessions to change society to accommodate their own CULT. It's not immediate. The plan is very long term. 10-100 years, makes no difference. As long as it takes to accomplish Jihad . They are very patient. God bless	1

None of the countries in the middle east will ever grant them permanent residency or citizenship, which of course you expect Europeans to do. No gulf Arab state has let them in, but surely you expect the West to alter it's values by a deluge of millions of people from an area in the world where Sunnis and Shiites are killing one another. Also, how is this encouraging moderates if you are letting moderates flow out by the millions and leaving extremists in the region? Expecting the world's ONLY Jewish state to accept millions of Muslims is probably one of the funniest things I have ever heard from someone.	0

It is interesting that these people of Sweeden, who got overwelmed with the wave of Syrians refugees ( that unfortunately have among them a lot of rapists, terrorists, etc.) only see the filthy romanian in their country.

I am a FILTHY ROMANIAN, and like many others of my compatriots living abroad, we don't ask for our religious holidays, we don't demand other people customs to be banned because they hurt our feelings and all this, and the list goes on and on.t And we certainly don't bomb you.	1

#Leo: Hungarian polices still accept refugees who register their identity going through the border to reach Germany or Austria. Those who fenced at the border are illegal, unregistered migrants. If they have nothing to hide, why dont they register themselves? Because they are not the real refugees? And if they are the real refugees, why do they fight against those who give them place, food, medical aids, trying to get into Hungaria anyway? They are acting like regardless people. It's way different from the example about 1956 you gave us man. Hungarian refugees followed the rules of the countries they were sent. It's now 2015 and people gotta obey the laws of which country where they stay. So in Hungary, refugees gotta register first before entering the land. That's the law, and that's all for the safety. I personal think Hungary is doing very good. #staystrongHungary	1

I lived in Sweden for 12 years. Wonderful place. Heja Sverige....! I left Sweden for the UK just as the SD were growing in momentum. Back then they were met with great disapproval - and disbelief - by fellow Swedes. I have sadly, yet almost understandably witnessed their growth in popularity. The problem seems to be twofold- lacklustre Swedish immigration / integration policies and a stubborn mentality towards a multicultural society (although this is still via a minority, thankfully) I recall moving to Stockholm in 1998, where you never saw the homeless on the streets, these days you can't walk more than four blocks with running into panhandlers... Who in many cases seem to be connected to foreign organised crime rings. What are the authorities doing about this? Nothing or very little, it seems... hence one can fathom the discontent. Not that the example above warrants racism, or even imply that SD are all racists (and yes, I would love to see the chap in the video being locked in a room full of Romanians and have him explain filthiness in greater detail...)	1

Kenny Hungary took refugees from neighbourghing countries many times in the past it is all documented. The difference is that those in the past cooperated and knew that they have obligations as refugees towards the country they seek asylum in. Yes, refugees do have obligations not rights only. We had refugees camps which are now closed as they are not used as most of them just want to go to Germany. What do you suggest we do now? Force them to register? That would be a good story for the BBC again.... Or lie down as doormats not enforcing EU law and use the money which should be spent on those who really need help on assisting people to go to Germany?	1

National identity is a concept that once served more or less to make peace within rival regions- and was in a way useful back then. But the way it's used now is to shut people out and create a false sense of identity between people who don't necessarily have anything in common. That is what's happening with SD- they claim that Swedes are homogenous and that we automatically share ''identity'' or ''culture'' which doesn't say shit- but is a tidier version to present of Hitler's idea of the white ''race''. Once again, to make myself extremely clear: national identity is a concept, a construct and it isn't real!! Nor is the Swedish culture- as culture is something that is endlessly influenced and interpreted by all kinds of people. Culture is dynamic and ever changing. It is impossible to say that there is one, true way to practice. But most importantly- it is NOT under threat. How could it be, as it is up to you to practice it yourself?? No one will stop you!	0

"Virtually all Muslims from Muslim countries [even the oil rich ones], are willing to do anything and everything....to escape those Muslim countries, in order to live in a Non-muslim country. Virtually no one in the world from a Non-muslim country....wants to go and live in a Muslim Cult country because of their Orwellian ""values"". The reasons are obvious. Even though they cannot openly and Consciously admit it....living within a country where everybody is literally Brainwashed from birth into a Cult, only leads to the lowest Standards of: Freedom of Thought/Expression/Sexuality/Choice, Civil and Human Rights, Education, and the lowest Standards of Living. That is life in a Muslim country. And that is why Muslims worldwide are Sub-consciously and Consciously desperate to live in Non-muslim countries. The reverse will never be true. And the more Brainwashed a Cult-member is to constantly deceive themselves..the more they will have to Deny what is staring them in the face about the sad truth of their Cult.]"	1

"Hungarians should remember that their parents were also refugees. *blink blink* People who now live in Hungary are obviously the ones whose parents did NOT flee... But not only that. In 56, it was a freedom fight against the Soviets, so the west had political reasons to accept them. They kept the refugees in camps for years, but refugees were okay with that, because their lives were in actual danger. No one rioted because he wanted to go to ""Germoney"". Hungarians accepted the country they were sent into, and knew that they have no right to choose where to go. Hungarians quickly blended in to Western societies, because their cultural and religious norms are very similar. And so on. Please don't compare actual refugees who accept what they get to tides of aggressive men who riot and take what they want unless stopped."	1

No multiculturalism = no inter-ethnic violence. I don't support violence against foreign people, but I also think that immigration is its own problem. I disagree that the US and UK are successful multicultures - they are largely segregated, and they seethe below the surface. Some support immigration while others oppose, but those who oppose are pressured into silence. I've recently moved to Japan on a work assignment, and there are very few foreigners here (Japan is 98.5% ethnically Japanese, even Tokyo is only 3% foreign). Some foreigners say it's a xenophobic society, but it's also one of the safest, cleanest, most prosperous and technologically advanced places you'll find anywhere. I question whether this would be possible with large numbers of refugees or other immigrants, particularly from countries where poverty is the norm and values are dramatically different. The refugee situation in Europe would be different if there were a clear plan to send people home at some point in the future, but there isn't, and as such, Europeans are faced with the prospect of being forced endlessly to absorb ever more people from broken nations, which will eventually make them minorities in their own lands. This isn't racism - it's reality - and you don't have to be a racist to see it	1

"Let's look after this country's homeless and elderly before anything else - Have you ever heard of this thing called the ""Welfare state""? The State pension is the UK's single biggest expenditure, followed closely by other entitlements like housing benefit. This country bends over backwards to help the elderly and the homeless, and the little support that migrants and refugees get is but the tiniest fraction of that. You might say ""well, benefits all go to immigrunts"", but you'd be wrong, as 95% of the welfare bill goes to British-born. ""How many are terrorists"" - Well, seeing as all major terrorist attacks in Europe over the last decade were carried out by people who were born in their target country, probably zero. ""What about the frail and elderly"" - See the earlier remark about pensions. ""What about the veterans that are too proud to ask for help?"" - If someone doesn't ask for help, it's very difficult to give it to them, isn't it. ""What about the victims of floods in Cumbria?"" - Households that've been flooded are being given ¬£5000 each by the Government, plus expenses for temporary accomodation. Many may also be insured. In spite of their current misfortune, Cumbria flood victims are in a much better position than the majority of refugees. Saudi Arabia is a crackpot-theocratic dictatorship that still has public executions. Not a country to aspire to."	0

Over the past years the UK had colonised half the planet with many former British colonies. The Brits have gone to war during both Word Wars in 20th century and Britain has flourished in the past due to people emigrating the UK and now the Tories and the UKIP Party complain about immigration because the Tories like the UKIP believe that migration is ruining the UK when in fact it has been proved that immigration boosts the country's economy. So if the UK leaves the EU, the Brits will loose the rights to travel freely and work in the EU and their other human rights since the UK are now part of the EU.	0

"The immigrant traffickers'ar winning. Because, now every European country is fighting against each other to see who's to blame. You have to protect your continent. At the beginning, the liberal Countries in Western Europe thought this was a normal war refugee exodus. Now, looks more like an invasion. Far too many, too quickly, etc. And despite 'being persecuted and tortures' etc seem to have the energy to riot. Never mind all those men leaving behind their wives and children behind. Do people need to wait until these refugees declare Europe an Islamic state or can we now agree that refugees must be processed and must have papers. Of course as decent humans we want to help the unfortunate but when they literally invade in droves and we don't have resources to deal with it, we need to think of our own well-being. That is not racist not egocentric. It is survival, and we residents have just as many rights to survive as any immigrant or refugee. let me laugh, 1200 only and Croatia is already overwhelmed. That may be 10% of migrants arrived to Hungary. But ""mean"" Hungary should let them all in of course. The Croatian Government have invited the immigrants / refugees, like the German Government did to show humanity and ‚Äûcompassion‚Äù and after only a single day, Croatia has thrown in the towel and said to the immigrants Go back to Hungary because it's closer and they stuck the immigrants / refugees in buses and trains and they sent back over ten thousand people back to the Hungarian border. This means hypocrisy and complicity with immigrant traffickers from all Balkan governments from the region. First you bait them in by saying you're overriding Dublin III and are planning on accommodating upto 800,000, now you do a 180¬∞ and all of them are stuck in Germany and Austria they said they could recieve millions of refugees for years no problem and that the Crisis wasn't a crisis but a problem of the heart and all the uneducated and naive believed them.

Lol this is so BS I have friends in the UK and I have seen people talk about the immigration in the UK and they are NOT very fond of it themself, so to sit and say that the UK and US have a working multiuculture is BS there are stores in the UK that discriminate against white people by for example only allowing polish or pakistanian people in them and we sure as hell don't have those here in sweden, such a misleading piece of shit video, but it is true that the sweden democrats is the currently leading political party, BUT its only cause of our current government has an irresponsible immigration policy and letting terrorists return and whoever else come and go as they please to sweden and this is how it will keep going either a new government is set in place or when people of sweden simply have had enough, sweden does not have a working integration and hasn't had it in over 20 years.	1

The only real problem of immigration is due to the Swedish governments inability to provide proper integration in order to decrease the level of xenophobia coming from the swedes and for the new comers to be able to reach their max potential. Another problem is that many swedish democrats are under the impression that immigration is only benefiting the immigrants, and not the host country itself. It is close mindedness that keeps them from realizing how immigration strengthens the workforce, and adds to the number of consumers thus leading to a better economy, and furthermore develops many aspects of culture through multiculturalism. If delt with properly, immigration is a win win situation.	0

I'll help her with some answers then : there are around 1 million foreigners now in Sweden More than half the population of Malm√∂ ( 3rd biggest city) has foreign background ! This year Sweden let in 2% of the population ( 200 000 people ) run into the country with or without a passport! That would be the equivalent of 5-6 million in the USA ( they are discussing 10 000 coming) For some reason Sweden is the only country in the world that's not allowed to stay Swedish ! In the future good swedes will leave and the lefties will be left to play with the Arabs and Somalians!	1

Hhhhhhh I am smiling! What a huge argument brought forward by Ty Royce Weldon. I would like to clarify a few points here. As far as refugees or refugee crisis is concerned, It is the laws of the European Union and the west that allow refugees enter into their territory. The same happens in the US. Mr. Ty Royce Weldon has criticised Islam strongly. Either he does not have complete information regarding it or media has brainwashed him strongly, because media shows him only what is seen by the eyes of the camera. In reality Islam never says you must force someone to convert to Islam, never allows a person to kill another human being, never allows to steal from another person, never allows to even enter the house of another person without his permission, etc. We need to respect the opinion of one another rather than critcise a whole religion. If we are used to the media and the media says that suicide bomber was a muslim from this so-called country, we directly believe it because seeing is believing, however the media never said that he was given a million dollars to carry out this bombing in a certain state, either european or asian, or that he was bought by ten million dollars and a ferrari or citiZenship of a specific well developed country. There are thousands of thousands of immigrants and refugees in Europe and the US who have embraced the customs and laws of these regions and who have never tried to impose anything upon a European or an American. I hope Mr. Ty and his followers in this argument would now agree with me. I am available to answer any questions you may have. I am a Writer in reality.	0

I know people in the UK hate the austerity measures, just imagine what these older people who are left in the dark! While I get called Islamaphobic, Homophobic (I am gay by the way) amongst other things because I am a right sided liberal like SD and FP by people who just shout a me because they know best.

Immigration or the EU are not the UK's actual problems. Like in most part of Europe, the UK is experiencing a wave of populism that has one major cause: neoliberalism. Neoliberal ideology has failed to deliver economic results because it is based on the false dogma of the self-regulating market. Since the market is supposed to regulate itself and the government can only save money and grant tax breaks to the rich (which is also a form of state intervention and another proof that self-regulating market never existed and never will exist), competition between parties in terms of different economic polices doesn't exist, hence the crisis of democracy. Moreover, the middle class has been declining and feels hopeless, but because they have been brainwashed into believing that the state can do nothing and poverty is people's own fault, they need to find a scapegoat. Immigrants and the EU are the perfect scapegoat, they are actually the main hope of neoliberal lobbies and ideologues to retain their power and influence.	0

The reality is the extra money required to maintain efficient infrastructure and NHS services is not 'available' by the government - stating that immigration and other issues is costing the government more money than it is, hence why it can't provide extra monetary resources. This is why more and more national resources require privatisation according the government to save money, and why the NHS is being primed for this. Just as an example...provisional data shows that there was a net flow of 163,000 migrants to the UK in the year ending June 2012...163,000. That is it, and that was taken from a government website. That total is 0.2% of the population (i went for 66mil as the pop of UK). Its not the migrants using benefits, because a lot of them/the vast majority are very hard workers and contribute massively to this economy...its the British people who think they are entitled to benefits because of a history of 'family entitlement' or think that is how life works - draining the benefits system (which should be a safety net, not something to live your life by). Drainage capacity? Stop paying farmers to keep their lands clean and clear, and pay them to grow more trees instead, that would help. Reforestation is proven to help combat flooding...but that is something else the government won't do. Leaving the EU...well, can't wait to hear your reaction the first time you want to go on holiday or travel over there if we did. That's my trendy lefty view though, sheepy righty views are more than welcome.	1

Most of them are in the EU because western corporations & their government lackeys are playing war games in their respective countries. They not only have no home, they have no country let alone an infrastructure to support them. Maybe those responsible should be brought to account..? Naturally for right wingers & religious fanatics this is a godsend. If you're looking to give them a platform then this is the way to do it. Inadvertently this is actually helping their cause. Taking in refugees is just pruning the branches & not actually dealing with the problem. & to be fair. Why isn't the EU asking the gulf states to take their fair share of refugees in? Oh yes. It's because they are the ones supplying the same groups we claim to be fighting. & we still do business with these fanatics?! We should do everything humanly possible to help them. But as long as the cause of the problem is still actively participating in their displacement we will see more of this right wing lunacy.	0

Education institutions are dominated by liberal agenda.

Former Muslim are lovely people, you liberals should do some more to promote and protect them instead of protecting those that just want to steal your money, rape you, impose sharia on you and make you a slave. That's not a progress, you are actually stooping the progress. Continue the tolerance rat race, they will enrich you culturally with Islamic doctrine. Good Muslim is the one that fallow the life of Muhammad, unfortunately Muhammad was nothing more than evil. They are only good for you right now because they need apologetic liberals like you.

Yes its true that immigration has to have some limits especially since we are a country of 9-10m and not 50m but it doesnt mean that you can't get to know the people around you. Whether SD likes it or not the current immigrants that are Swedish citizens will not simply leave so why the hell would you make them an enemy? If SDs argumentation was better and more friendly in their approach then they wouldnt be so hated but since everything they say is of a bad mouth its hard to be friends with them."	0

I have a friend from Hungary and he has told how much damage they have caused. E.g They were transport in couches and they destroyed & left couches in disgusting useless state. Even when they were being helped! They don't want to be registered to be assisted. They just want to take things by force. Another example ate those who got asylum in Uruguay a year ago. Now they're complaining about cost of life there and want to go back to Syria. No all of them are full of jealousy and greed for European lifestyle but my friend said that vast majority are. I wonder what rich Arab countries are doing? Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates? Why are only Europe and America the world's problems resolvers? Why nobody makes President Assad responsible?	1

Wayne - i'm sure that's all well and good (not that we can tell, since you haven't provided a source...), but it doesn't change the fact that some fundamentalist Muslims entirely DO believe in all those things you listed.

EU - giving vast amount of money to be governed by them, when Countrys outside the EU can manage the running of their Country without outsider help. Immigration - love knowing different nationalites, its not the people but rather the strain on facilities, utilities and other resources. How big does the EU think our Country is? Also the British public vote for whom they feel should run this Country, but does not seem to have a say on the EU. So to Angela Merkyl I say, look David Cameron is our Prime Minister and the majority of the British public put him there to run our Country. Any contracts signed between him or any other previous government is not a legal document as the British Public have the voice not the one we put in office and as such the British Public will not bow down to threats from overseas. We live on a ball in the vasts of space and she dictates as if she rules the EU Public. But the EU public did not ask nor want such a dictatorship from an unknown not voted on element.	1
Attention seeker, has nothing to do with Christianity, if she was a Christian she would very well know that Muslims and Christians don't worship the same God, proof enough that she has no clue about anything. Second point if you were a Christian you wouldn't insult the day that the whole world celebrates as the birth date of the birth of Christ by supporting an evil belief system that means to wipe out humanity 'non believers' I love Muslims yes, but I hate Islam's teachings. You need to know what God you are worshipping before you make stupid statements like that, because if you were a Christian you would know very well that there is no way that islams' God is the Christian God, there is no comparison what so ever,. You want to support Muslims go ahead, but don't insult the Christians while doing it.	1

Sweden, I'm American , from Gettysburg PA , USA, and we are a nation of immigrants and are going through the same argument about taking Syrian Refugees right now. Our right-wing party , the Republicans are filling the country full of fear , saying we should not take 10,000 Syrian Refugees because there will be terrorist hidden among them. Europe has a history of Facism , Nazism , and Racism , as do we. I do not live my life in fear, however after reading all of your comments , it does give me pause on the economic , criminal , and religious effects this immigration may cause . I was one that wanted to take the Refugees , but after hearing your countries thoughts, I will do some more consideration .	1

Please keep in mind that these people represent a minority of swedes, about 13%. They represent the poor educated and narrow minded people of sweden, and originally come from nazi ideology.

It's irritating to constantly mix up 'not welcoming' with racism everywhere not only for Sweden. Inhospitable does not mean racist plus hospitality has the limits of the host. Sweden belongs to Swedes, let them decide respectfully who and how many people they want to welcome in their country without criticizing. As far as I know Swedes are usually welcoming and open minded, but let's say if tomorrow they decide that they don't want a multicultural society that wd be out of a democratic free choice, who are we to criticize that?! There are different places in the world with different cultures reflecting different values, some are superficially multicultural, rare are those truly multicultural! in reality most of the time you have to adapt to quite some extent to the country where you live or visit, that's how we can share somehow this planet.	0

All of this sounds exactly the same as arguments in the USA. It's really telling to sit back and read these comments. 2 extreme sides to each point, both sides stating that their side is based on facts. Happens here as well. Hhmmmm........I'm thinking both sides are stating the facts that support their ideology, rather than any actual facts. People are getting their facts from their sides' mouthpieces. Just my guess anyways. In other words, we all play into the establishments hands instead of forming our own opinions. I'm guilty too.

This is only a propaganda. First of all, a Muslim cannot teach anyone to be a suicide bomber and being a Muslim I don't like it, same as other Muslim.

We all know Whitehouse laid a foundation stone of Taliban and ISIS is not different.	1

Same-sex couples and single people should only be able to adopt a kid if they're closely related to it, or if they already have a parent-child relationship with it. 3. No abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy. 4. Major strategic cuts and legislations forcing women to stay at home with their litter of kids, like income splitting.

The majority of swedes are not afraid of the immigrants and a multicultural country. The truth is that we have a undemocratic political group called the Swedish Democrats. They try to fill peoples hearts with fear and anger. Unfortunately they have managed to do it among males (mostly) who are uneducated, many of them out of work... They talk about Sweden as a country it has never been: all people thinking the same, all people liking the same things, all people wanting the same things... Sweden is one of the richest countries. Of course the immigrants will cost a lot og money in the beginning. But we need to be more inhabitants since we have a low nativity. My biggest fear is not the refugees that come here. My biggest fear is the neonazists in SD and their followers. They are the ones that spreads hate, anger, fear and who act out this in many ways. Why should there otherwise be fires in many places as soon as they asked their members to work outside the parliament? And when their leader said that he hoped there would be no more fires they suddenly stopped?	1
The real crime is the Swedish governments inability to see this coming and stop it before it became a problem. This problem was totally avoidable and it was the responsibility of the government to make sure the citizens of Sweden were never put in this position.	0

"We have huge immigration in Canada as well. I'm not certain but I believe we welcome more immigrants to Canada than any other country. Our gov't tells us that we need immigration to replace our ""aging population"" as our birthdate is below the replacement rate. However I'm beginning to question the real motivation for why mass immigration is continually rammed down our throats. We can't even have a decent debate without accusations of racism- never mind the fact that immigrants come in white too. I'm beginning to believe that immigration does more harm than good in the short-term and it negatively impacts ""natives"" and even the second generation of long-established immigrants. First of all, while many immigrants are highly skilled/educated, we must ask why do we import skilled people?? Why are we no longer offering affordable training/post-secondary schooling to ""natives""? In Canada and the U.S., the costs of tuition is becoming more and more prohibitive and burdensome. It's not as ""easy"" for everyone to take on massive debts, that could take decades (yes, in some cases decades) to pay off. And why don't our governments care if its own people are educated?? Because keeping people ignorant and desperate means that they will tow the line. Govt's MUST invest in their own people and stop importing foreigners trained ""specialists."" Here in Canada we are experiencing wage stagnation and the loss of unionization. Somehow the average Canadian has been hoodwinked into believing that unions are useless and costly- even the U.S. has higher rates of unionization than us, albeit their union population is shrinking also. Immigrants tend to come from countries where a unionized workforce is unheard of and worker/human rights violations are rampant! So these people come here and, admittedly, they are willing to work the crap jobs that the average Canadian won't take. Why won't the average Canadian take these low-pay Wal-Mart jobs? Because one can barely survive on the wages!! The unskilled immigrants are usually desperate enough to take any work and they will do it without complaint. This allows our govts and businesses to keep the pay for low-skilled jobs at barely sustenance levels where people will likely never be able to seek out the training/education required to move up the societal rungs and it is increasingly likely that they never be able to put their children through college on such meager wages. However the fact that immigrants will ""happily"" do these crappy jobs, in turn makes the ""hard working"" immigrant laudable compared to the natives who are accused of being ""too proud"" to do low pay wirk. then the people who blindly support unfettered immigration, and accuse those who call for restraint ""racists"" and ""bigots"". Unskilled immigrants are not your ""heroes"" because they take on our shit work; often they are people who are used to poor, oppressive working conditions so they'll do the work that no one else wants. So in sum, our governments want to import two kinds of immigrants to the detriment of ""native"": ready-made skilled immigrants so that they can keep domestic tuitions expensive and out of reach for their own people. And the unskilled immigrants will do the crappy jobs because they have no choice and the odds are that Canada's shitty jobs are an improvement from third world factory work. I'm not any-immigration. But we need to fix domestic problems before we simply import disadvantaged people to do our slave work for us. Question the REAL reasons why our governments and big business love mass immigration. Is it really in everyone's best interest??"	1
We hear this from our family over there, they think it's because of migration of EU folks that there are no jobs for Brits, they forget that the migrants take the jobs they would have refused as too up low-paying or too many hours...

Tihomir, you are indeed correct. As the picture is beginning to clear, the vast majority of the immigrants are not from war torn Syria.

Moreover, very few are genuine refugees; even under the outdated conventions, as they have already passed through a number of safe havens e.g. Turkey.	1

Food for Thought: One of my own misunderstandings, due to the structure of our society, was that we as followers of Christ should punish those who harm us. If the Church suffered apostacy early in the middle ages, then, it just may be that the early Christians followed Christ‚Äôs teachings even to the point of not pursuing civil punishment of those who harmed them. Christ‚Äôs teaching was ‚Äúto turn the other cheek‚Äù, and forgive those who persecute you. We follow the tradition of Roman law because the traditional power structures of western civilization emerged from the Roman society. One of the keys to understanding how to have Christ‚Äôs power in your life may be to accept the actions of others without attempting to use civil government to punish the offender, which is accepted by scholars as a system of human justice implemented to prevent individuals from seeking revenge independently. Remember, Christ said, ‚Äújudge not, that ye be not judged, I shall repay saith the Lord of Hosts.‚Äù No person will find it easy to ignore those who purposefully take advantage of them, but those who choose to emulate Christ, by caring for others, avoiding greed and materialism, and refusing to harm others may actually be able to call on Christ aid in time of need; this would be helpful when facing climate change.	0

As has been pointed out by MANY. These are mostly able bodied men. Refugees stop at the first point of safety... Meaning Turkey or Greece. Refugees do not throw food or rocks at citizens, dump water, and riot screaming Allahu Akbar and Osama is great. Refugees take what is offered to them until proper accommodations can be made for them. They do not demand ANYTHING because they are guests in another country. I did not want to believe it before but the more I see, I see this as an invasion. ISIS promised to reformation of the Caliphate. In their interpretation this includes all lands EVER held under Muslim dominion. Does anyone know their history? The last time Muslims ran across Europe in these numbers ended with the Ottoman Empire laying siege to Vienna 1683 September 11-12. ISIS interpretation of the Caliphate includes Spain, Sicily, and Europe the whole way to Vienna. Why are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and U.A.E. not taking these people in. They have more money than Europe and more jobs available. This has little to do with being Muslim this has to do with a mentality of being owed something. These people should have overthrown the Assad father and son instead of rallying for the downfall of the West for the last 50 years. Funny how people who HATED the west a few years ago are now whining that the wast is not doing enough.	1

"Its so ironic how the video ended with Guardian ""the whole- picture""? When they only showed half the picture of the immigration-problem in sweden. 70 percent of the video showed racist sdu-brats not caring about other people. But the Swedish democrats are not a racists. Theyre just tired of the governments naive and irresponsable immigration-politics. The sad truth is there are lack of finances, jobs, homes, and resources for education and wellfare. Sweden is a mess, not because of the immigrants, but because of the naive politicians not closing the borders like other countries, simply because theyre scared of being called ""racists"" for being realistic. Its all about political correctness and status. This video is so much propaganda. Ask a normal average swede and they probably vote for SD. And there is Nothing wrong with that!"	1

I wonder if this whole EU and immigration thingie is so skewed here because we've never been occupied in modern times. I've friends in a number of EU countries who see membership as a fundamental element in a stable continent - this arising from direct family experience of being occupied and subject to appalling experiences during said occupation. We see the question from our perspective, I think we should be grateful that the EU still wants us in spite of our juvenile posturing.	0

I wished people would stop trying to be right on etc. The realities are that there is a finite number of people that our infrastructure and systems can cope with. Whether you want to be trendy leftie or not we cannot continue to allow all and sundrie to come. We don't have a housing shortage, we have a people excess. We can hardly manage with what we have, we really need to control our borders (the trendy leftie lovies among you please note I did not say close). Have you noticed the increase in floods etc, do you think that might have a tiny bit to do with concreting over more land than we should have, thus limiting drainage capacity? Even if you take the view that many come to work, and that is not disputed by me, the fact is most are low paid, meaning that in work benefits etc almost certainly means they are a net cost, and another job that could go to someone already here. Points based work visa system works elsewhere, it could be made to work here, but we would have to leave the eu, which is fine by me.	1

I'm a mixture of 3 countries and I'm Jewish. I have Muslim friends, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, etc. I think ca 150000 immigrants a year is too much! Where should they go? The appartments are too expensive, I mean I can't even fucking afford one.. How could they? And ofc there is violence.. Can you imagine what they have been through. Some people has grown up watching bombs coming from side to side. They are mentally ill for life.. And to just put immigrants all with each other will make more violence because they have nothing. And now they start working together to go against having nothing! I'm not saying all are! But the majority of young immigrants in Sweden unfortunately are. We should split everyone up to all the different countries in the eu, but of course not split their families because that would be cruel! What I'm saying is that there is a solution for everything but people (countries) choose not to cooperate. So there it is. Tack f√∂r mig leverpastej hope you all have a fucking good day!	1

1.The flow of people having to move from their country of origin to find refuge from wars and destruction created by western governments ,who have created instability , hardship and poverty on a massive scale throughout the Middle East ,it is now a matter for the world everywhere to take responsibility for helping were we can ,and accept that migration will have to take place and to accept that this is the situation , the Swedish national union party like so many others need to realise that, that they like everyone else have a responsibility to the situation that is happening now with the amount of refuges being created by a sinister ideology from western governments only to enrich ourselves to feed the insatiable greed for oil and gas, I'm sure once the oil in the area runs out it will be peaceful again and that it really has nothing to do with religion at all .. I don't believe that more hatred is required on top of what is already a tough situation for everyone refugees and hosting populations alike ,answers and solutions need to found and the more tolerance that can be created the easier the situation is to sort out.	0

"Take a lesson from Denmark. They didn't remove all their migrants, they removed something like a couple hundred of the most violent that they had caught (while Sweden refuses to deport serial rapists that prey on their own citizens), and their crime rates for the year dipped by TWENTY percent. I'm not asking for gas chambers and armbands and death squads. I'm asking for common fucking sense, something you know by a different name- hate. Yes, apparently it's hate to want criminals our of your country if they're brown enough.

Sadly there are wolves in among the sheep, yes, most refugees are not terrorists or ISIS supporters, but the ones that are terrorists and ISIS supporters are hiding among the innocents. I'm sure at least some of the innocent refugees know who they terrorists and ISIS supporters are but don't speak up. While I feel badly for the innocent refugees, my own safety and the safety of my loved ones must come first so until the a better job of weeding out the killers can be done, and it's pretty obvious as shown by recent events that it's it's not being done now, the refugees are not my priority.	1

I think Sweden has to focus on integrating its own people a bit better, for Sweden have unwittingly cultivated serious psychosocial problems in its countryside. It is clear to see that this minority of individuals suffers from fear, and fear is what is continuing to drive their cause.

"What ignorant lier said that Swedish is NOT the Rape Capital of Europe?!? Seriously , the worst thing I know is people who blatantly defend something by pure denial, without even having read the statistics! The most idiotic way for a debater who expects people to respect their opinions is to NOT make any research, but instead making claims based on their own beliefs that "" No, this is too horrible for me to accept, and therefore I will NOT in any way even consider that this is true. Just like a child that denies that he came into existing by his parents having sexual intercourse, because his parents would never do such a thing!!"" Sadly though, if you just Google ""country with highest rapes"" the top page you'll see is Wikipedia: Rape Statistics - and here is an excerpt from that page : - In Australia the reported rape rate per 100,000 people is relatively high, although it is in a decreasing trend, coming down from 91.6 in the year 2003 [28] to 28.6 in 2010.[29] This stands in contrast to reported rape rate of 1.2 per 100,000 in Japan, 1.8 per 100,000 in India, 4.6 rapes per 100,000 in Bahrain, 12.3 per 100,000 in Mexico, 24.1 per 100,000 in United Kingdom, 28.6 per 100,000 in United States, 66.5 per 100,000 in Sweden, and world's highest rate of 114.9 rapes per 100,000 in South Africa.[28][29] - This sadly making Sweden the number one rape country in Europe, only to be surpassed by South Africa. But it shocks me that not more women are fighting against the fact that Sweden has the SECOND highest rate of rape IN THE FUCKING WORLD!!! I mean, with all these feminist movements and political groups we have in Sweden not ONE actually addresses the most hideous crime that a woman can ever be subjected to?! What the hell is wrong with people??? Stand up for your sisters in your own country instead of denying the facts and instead protecting the thousands of men that thrive on this rape culture...

"We should know that development and migration are intrinsically related, that the capitalist system inherently develops unevenly, that the British regime is part and parcel of economic policies imposed on poor countries through various means (IMF, World Bank, support of dictatorships, freedom of their corporations to plunder, etc, etc), that the same regimes have played a significant role in aborting the attempt of the same people fleeing ""their countries"" in overthrowing the oppressive system at home (see the so-called Arab Spring, the elections, the NGOs, etc) all in order to maintain the status quo. Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism."	1

Muslims are convinced of the perfection contained in their religion that encompasses all the aspects of life and hold Christians and Jews as inferior, imperfect believers. That feeling of superiority is not confirmed by the kind of life they live in Europe. This creates massive frustration, hostility towards their European hosts and a reaction of becoming even more radical. The Muslims of Europe are generally against integration not to speak of assimilation. There might be a few exceptions but these confirm the general rule: Muslims do not approve of the Western World.	1

For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head.

"Yes. No one dismisses the statistics, it's the comparison between different countries that is misleading. The purely statistical rise in the number of rapes per 100 000 inhabitants in Sweden is partly due to legislative changes. Unlike before and other countries, we now count all separate incidents, and we have also gotten a much wider definition of rape. Besides those facts, more rape victims report the crimes than before. So. If we, like other countries, were to lump tens, hundreds or thousands of rapes together, we would indubitably have ended up further down the list. The same goes for if we, like other countries, would have a narrower definition of rape. Reality isn't what it looks like on paper ‚Äì especially not in many, many other countries. Winston: Vad syftar du p√•? ü§î Eric Sneed: I've spent many nights in Roseng√•rd, but it didn't make me hate immigrants. Did I do it wrong..? And no, I don't live in an ""all white community"" in Stockholm, as if that would automatically make me more tolerant towards immigrants."	0

"Habab - you can't really criticise people for using statistics in a way you don't like, when you either don't tell the truth, or don't confirm your sources. To quote your first post ""FYI refugees in the UK and most Western European states are not entitled to any benefits. They receive a nominal amount of 15 to 20 pounds everyweek in vouchers and are given accommodation in a hostel."" Now, to quote the UNHCR... ""The majority of asylum seekers do not have the right to work in the United Kingdom and so must rely on state support. Housing is provided, but asylum seekers cannot choose where it is, and it is often ‚Äòhard to let‚Äô properties which Council tenants do not want to live in. Cash support is available, and is currently set at ¬£36.95 per person, per week, which makes it ¬£5.28 a day for food, sanitation and clothing."" http://www.unhcr.org.uk/about-us/the-uk-and-asylum.html Also, for your information, UK currently spends ¬£726,000 a day housing refugees and asylum seekers. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11443871/Bill-for-asylum-seekers-bed-and-board-hits-726000-a-day.html Am I saying we don't have a moral responsibility to help?

"Immigration is a problem in a country where 98.5% of the people are Japanese? LOL. This is not a matter of being ""nice"", the issue of immigration is much more complex, try reading something about European history. We don't live on an island here and we have a history of colonial empires. As for the matter of refugees, this is not just a question of politics against 'niceness' and it's a different matter from that of immigration. The UN 1951 Refugee Convention is based on the declaration of human rights, which states that all individuals have the right to seek asylum from persecution in other countries. So basically, yes, it is a question of morality: these people are fleeing war and death. We are not being ""nice"" to them, we are being humane. Like all many Europeans, I also somehow fear that we might let terrorists posing our refugees within our borders, but I also think that racist and xenophobic actions in our society will only do harm and radicalise people. We need to have stricter checks on people who are given asylum. Things are not in black and white..."	0

Hungary and Croatia are buffer zones for Germany and Austria who sent out the order to blockade the migrants. EU/Germany ( under the rule of Hitlers daughter Angela Merkel) will try and force Romania to accept most if not all the migrants. What will the migrants do its the real question. Will they accept to be forced to live here or will they insist on moving to the promise land, Germany. Personally I think USA and Germany should split the migrant number in half and adopt them. It is their mess and they should be responsible for this not other countries.	1

"Guardian, you should be ashamed. How dare you present the argument that the UK ""already has a thriving multicultural society"" and thereby suggest that Sweden does not. How many Syrians have you taken in? How many bombs have you dropped? I certainly agree that some of what SD representatives come out with is atrocious and racist; but the core issue that the party represents is one that shouldn't be - yet is - overlooked. When mainstream parties refuse to listen to their electorate, opting instead to classify their opinions as markers of fascism, the result is a surge in the popularity of fringe parties. If our government - or indeed parties in the opposition, such as the Moderates - had actually taken this issue seriously, we wouldn't be in a position where the latest poll shows that SD is now Sweden's biggest party. But they don't listen, and they pride themselves on ensuring that Sweden is seen as the best, most open and tolerant country, instead of actually ensuring that we can look after the people to whom we give asylum. The result is that we take in far too many asylum seekers who have no option but to live in tents in the freezing cold. That's not humane, and it's not democratic."	1
Nice unbiased reporting there! I guess liberals are going to believe whatever dished up to them until the facts are too blatant to ignore. Please explain why when a Swede kills migrants it is reported en masse, but when a migrant kills local swedes, rather than sympathy for the victims the story is covered up, barely reported, and security at migrant centres increased to protect against backlash. If everybody here wants equality and integration so much, why are two so similar attacks treated so differently? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33880348	1

I find it extremely amusing that most individuals decreeing and demanding that Western Europe stops accepting migrants are people and countries in Eastern Europe. Basically people who are still in the dark ages, are still very much racist and well unwelcoming. I also suspect it is largely to do with the fact that they also come here to claim housing and welfare. FYI refugees in the UK and most Western European states are not entitled to any benefits. They receive a nominal amount of 15 to 20 pounds everyweek in vouchers and are given accommodation in a hostel. So seriously get off your high horse and before you preach hate look in the mirror. Read and get informed on the refugee laws... also check the statistics on the amount of EE workers who come here claim housing, benefits and work minimum wage jobs or alternatively work for cash in hand to avoid Tax payment. Those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.... also an immigrant or refugee who has qualifications and studied his/her butt off aren't stealing your jobs if all you have is a gcse and want to get out of bed at midday..... Also remember WWII this is where we will be heading if you don't curb and limit this horrid mentality and way of thinking... no one is saying open the boarders... one is suggesting vetting and to stop dehumanising fellow humans simply because of their background, ethnicity or religious beliefs. SHAME!!!	1

We have 300k unemployed people in a country with population of 4 million so you can imagine that we can't take any more hopeless cases + no help in handling the situation from the EU countries. And the most important thing - the migrants have been given shelter, food and water and they don't want to stay. They scream ""Freedom!!!"" and choose to walk around Zagreb, sleep on benches, look for transportation and move towards Slovenia and Hungary. They say that they know we can't provide for them.

"No decent anthropologist would even use the word ""civilization"". And no decent anthropologist would use the word ""European culture"". There is no one European culture. There is Hungarian culture, Polish culture, French culture - and within those you have countless distinctive regional differences. No decent anthropologist would call Islam savagery. A decent anthropologist knows history of religion and history of Islam well enough to understand the subtle nuances. He knows that there are countless peaceful Muslims living around the globe. He understands the diversity of theological schools within Islam. He understands the diversity within the Middle East. So I'm sorry, dear ""American majoring in anthropology"", but you simply suck at what you do."	1

@Tolousain Andreu. UK, over these past four years, have provided more aid and assistance, doctors, clinics,medicines,services, food, tents etc etc etc, than the rest of Europe combined. In the world, UK has only been exceeded by USA in providing aid for the refugees in the countries surrounding Syria. The gulf states are also providing a lot of money to aid the refugees. I think they generally feel a large influx of non-gulf Arabs permanently coming to reside in their countries introduces an unnecessary risk to the future well -being of their nations. Palestinians have been denied citizenship of many of the arab countries they have lived in for fifty years. So, it is unsurprising.	0
"Finally someone gets it. I would like to consider myself a very kind and respectful person, not having too big problems with people from other countries coming to Sweden by any means.

The IRA didn't. But youngsters where pretending to be 16 so they could go and fight for them cos it seemed exciting. One of the reasons I hate the forces. They make these amazing videos showing how exciting it is. They don't don't show real men lying with heads arms and legs blown off, they don't show the man lying in a gutter in the city because he was injured so no use to the forces any longer and has lost everything including his home. They don't show the many forces people with severe mental health issues because of the atrocities they've experienced. No they show the fun, the adventure the excitement, the promise of a career and good pay. They're just as evil. And as for this man on the video and others like him. They are not teaching Islam, they are ISIS, they are terrorists who hide behind the name of religion, hide behind Islam to carry out their evil acts. The sooner people understand and see this the sooner people will leave religion and religious people alone. A truly religious person does not harm others. Stop blaming religion and start seeing the evil for what it really is. As for the beautiful place. These children have been taken to a beautiful place in order for them to feel relaxed and happy and believe that what is being pushed into their little minds is good and okay.	0

Europe should follow Hungary's and UK's example. Hungary is defending its borders and its people as each sovereign state should do against undocumented, aggressive, rude thugs. UK declared will take in refugees from the camps in Syria where they have been already checked up by United Nations Refugee Agency. So, I believe Germany owes an apology to the other EU member countries for irresponsibly encouraging undocumented individuals to ‚Äò‚Äôassault‚Äô‚Äô Europe. You know the saying ‚Äò‚ÄôCharity starts at home‚Äô‚Äô is still true. The responsible way to help the ones in need starts at home. First take care of your needy, then go to the refugee camps and select those who deserve, who really suffered and get them on planes straight to Germany by the hundred of thousands if that‚Äôs what you want.. That way the chaos and tensions that we have seen for the past several weeks between the migratory young males that are invading Europe and the locals could have been prevented.	1

Humanity hitting a new low, offensive is far to polite. They should take a look at their own history when their country was suffering. Between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States. In the early 20th century, more Swedes lived in Chicago than in Gothenburg (Sweden's second largest city). Most Swedish immigrants moved to the Midwestern United States, with a large population in Minnesota, with a few others moving to other parts of the United States and Canada.	0

It's not physics, but newtons third law applies. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. if you have the most extreme refugee policy in the western world some people will obviously react in an extreme way. This extreme reaction in turn creates another extreme reaction (AFA, RF, etc) so basically our government has created nothing but chaos. But i guess it's alright, as long as we don't appear racist. all the money that has went to refugees could've been used to help people in refugee camps very efficiently. But i guess swedes aren't satisfied with merely knowing that they helped, they need others too know aswell. And don't deny that, we have all seen plenty of posts on facebook how someone donated 100Kr to the red cross or something similar. what makes Sweden great is that it handles most things in moderation, balancing alot of aspects of society almost perfectly. The current migration policy is about as balanced as Steven Seagals diet. To summarize, you are either vain or ignorant, or both. Fuck you all.	1

First of all there aren't many swedish people left in Sweden. Most are mixed. I didn't have a problem with immigrants until I became a teenager. I was experiencing all this hate towards me because I was swedish. People hated me because I was blonde and I actually ended up as a brunette which I hated, but I couldn't go to school or go outside without being attacked by immigrants just because of my hair colour. People also hated me because of my light skin. Today I'm afraid of immigrants and I'm very sorry because of that. I wish I didn't expect them to be rude and aggressive.	1
We are a global market now with the internet and cannot escape this fact. People decrying the EU forget that years back everything had 'customs charges' as in items to/from the USA. If I buy an item from the US I get a handling charge to check for customs duty even if a few pounds is added. There is no redress as the 'appeal' is done by the people levying the charge so learnt 'Never buy from the USA' unless mega cheap . If we leave the EU this will return. We are an island so many goods are sent in with varying price differentials to mainland Europe and America. Prices will rise, property will drop about a third we will face the coming problems from global warming ourselves and the fact much of our fuel is coming from Russia and other countries. Grow up look at the size and position of our country and think if we are alone how do we survive we are not Switzerland in the middle of the land mass. Stop living thinking the world is pink on an Atlas and face reality we are a small island with many many fewer problems than some countries be grateful for what we have and work with reality... The mass immigration at present is financial brought on by wars in Africa and Arabia, many will return as contrary to many Britain's streets are not paved in gold but empty litter cartons.	0

I think immigration does have its benefits. Also as an English woman living abroad I'd be a hypocrite if I thought and said differently. I live in Anguilla it's a British Overseas Territory in the Eastern Carribean. I'm here because of my husband's job. He specialises in a field that the Island needed and didn't have. He has full residence status as long as he works for the Government. I on the other hand as a wife have an extended permit to stay the length of his contract. With big words saying Prohibited from working. So any UK citizen like myself are prohibited from working yet any citizen of this Island can can go and live and work in the UK. There are no equality laws here and its only by being away from my homeland that I see how we are protected by laws that are beneficial to society and economy of the UK. Not all immigration is bad and I feel if we walked away from Europe it would be a terrible mistake.	0

I feel ashamed. I hope most people here won't get the idea that this is representing the Swedes. Most SD-followers are closet-racists. They have these thoughts, but they are cowards who are brave with a keyboard or in a group. They present immigration as a problem and a cause of all sorts of bad things, but they don't and can't present a solution. I embrace all cultures and hope that you all could visit here once at least.	1

"Isn't it ironic that you're saying we should sort out our own problems but yet you were in Iraq helping other people?

People can be helped irrespective of who they are, surely? What do you mean by ""liberal ideology"" and what are you currently doing to help the people displaced by flooding?"	0
"did I say that? Don't put words in my mouth. I am talking about the political party - not the voters. I believe people voting this party are blinded by their incapacity to put themselves in other people's shoes - which makes it harder for them to recognize the bullying that is going on against immigrants in Sweden by this political party (mostly muslims, but also people like me, which I believe gives me the right to be angry), but that doesn't make them racists, just self-centered. And yes. I do believe 20 percent of the population is self-centered because to me there's no other explanation. I would get angry if you were treated that way, the fact that you don't, makes me question your moral. But since you're here, if you want to learn how to recognize the bullying, here's an example: just read the guy below you. I personally encounter people like him every single day. Words like his no longer hurt, I've become used to them as I believe many others also have. But I do fear him and it makes me feel uncomfortable to know people like him exist and are walking freely on the streets. I worry for my kids safety. My nine year old son was recently pushed by a 30+ old man, for absolutely no reason other than him walking right next to me, holding my hand as we passed him while exiting the store. The man had a sticker on his car that read ""Keep Sweden clean!"". He I do think is a racist. The day the voting ended giving the Sweden democrats 13% of the votes - a car drew by me, my son and my six year old daughter. A guy riding the passenger's seat threw a can at us and screamed ""SD, for fucks sakes! Out with the blackheads"" (blackheads referring to immigrants with darker features, like my dark hair - For those who wonder.) He was probably also a racist. I can give you a thousand more examples like these, all starting when SD began to brainwash people into thinking discrimination is okay by doing it themselves - regularely. But i won't sit here and spill you all my problems - especially since you're not going to relate. But I will say this; Most people in Sweden never used to be politically enthusiastic, it was almost taboo to talk about politics a few years ago. I remember being political and annoying people when bringing the subject up, because it was what they called ""boring"" and they said they didn't even worry about voting because accourding to them ""who cares?"". They would not even inform themselves about whom to vote and why, just vote whoever came to mind right there and then. Now suddenly it's a trend to express opinions and the same people who thought it was boring to do so are the first in line to vote for this particular party (not the only ones, but from what I've seen they are many). But since they never had that interest before, most of these people have no clue what they are talking about - even less understand how the world works or why things are the way they are. The result of that? Bad political judgement. The other day a spoke to a girl - SD supporter, who thought Syria was an african country, that they were fighting for oil and wanted to take Swedish oil next (let that sink in). Another girl said she didn't know who ISIS was but she knew he was bad. He. As in one person. I am not saying all SD supporters are like this, but quite a few are and it's seriously terrifying. With all this said, answer if you like - I'll read it and evaluate what you have to say in that case, but don't expect another answer - I might, just don't expect one, because neither of us will convince the other and it would be pointless to continue. I just felt like emptying my chest this once and now that's done. Signed: A rat born in a stable (a term used on me by SD supporters several times for having been born in Sweden)."	0

"Immigration is good for any society but the way this and previous governments have managed and ""controlled"" it are appalling.....the money wasted, hand over fist, would be better spent investing in the countries where these immigrants are coming from ...creating business opportunities locally, financed by us but with financial benefits to us as well....at present it's a hand to mouth existence plugging holes and having no idea who is entering, where they are going, and whether they are justified to benefits or not. Shambolic and an example of how UK governments have only a short term view (to the next election) of anything.....when it comes to defining strategy I cannot see one coherent 5 or 10 year plan emanating from any government ministry and certainly nothing that ""joins up"" the government into a cohesive unit.

They seem like a bunch of ignorant racists, and this is how the Guardian would like to depict anyone who isn't a multi-cultural progressive. In reality, a country has a right to protect its culture and to limit its intake of immigrants. As opposed to what the racists in the article think, immigrants actually enrich a culture and an economy. But, when you have such a huge mass of people arriving from a very different culture, it's very hard for to integrate them, it dramatically changes the characteristics of a country, and it's a recipe for trouble.	1
This is the mentality governments and people don't understand. Muslims put their religion above everything, including laws and allegiance to country. This causes a lot of cultural issues and integration problems because everyone else who lives in their country expect those who migrate there to put the country first.	0

This crisis will only end if there is peace and everyone will stop blaming each other. First, the UN and esp the Arab and Gulf states and Russia need to work together to obliterate ISIS and then they can deal with Assad and what is left of Syria. I find it odd, that the UN worked together to get rid of Milosevic but have done nothing to get rid of Isis, which is 10 fold more horrific. After this, Syria needs to be partitioned off just like Bosnia was to end the war there, with each sect getting a different partition, but still under the country of Syria as obviously these people cannot get along.	0
It's easier to be safe and hate a rasist than to go out on the streets to protect women from being raped. It's all a matter of choice. Some people choose the gun, some people choose the megaphone, some people choose the hand, and some people choose the iPhone. What will you choose?	0

Sweden has let in 200 000 mostly males from the Middle East! Most without even showing a passport ! That is extreme! Rapes have sky rocketed! In proportion to the population it would be as if USA let 5-6 million in! Some of witch are part of terror organizations! They don't let in one person! You from P.rico should know how hard it is to get into the states You don't think people would get mad if there were no borders ? There are soon 107 males to every 100 women in the country! You expect women to cheer that ?	1
@Habab Mohd. One in four babies born in London last year, had parents that were not UK nationals. This, in itself, represents the receipt of benefits, and with all of what goes with that for the future, schooling etc, it represents a great deal of resources.

Do you understand that not everyone who would like to donate to the British in need, or to any charity in fact, don't have the financial situations to do so. Wages are very low for some. Doesn't mean people don't have the right to their opinions. Also, how dare you call people who care about the homeless, idiots! So people who want to see them have a better life are idiots???? Tut, tut. Your post is a perfect example of double standards.	1
"One cannot simply ignore the facts that DMT proves all religion and all conciousness as one. People in Sweden should start taking stands on this topic before they adress any political issues or agendas. If they dont understand how we got here (shamanism and DMT use) there really is no good idea to listen to them as they have no understanding at all what they are doing. If you watch the videolist I shared you will notice that these problems in peoples minds will be solved when the get the medicine they need. Also people may start knowing a little bit more about the real world other than the cultures they enjoy and live in as time/money, materialism, christmas, easter ect. What every human should know about is Shamanism, DMT, Ayahuasca, Psilcoybin, Religion, Christian gnostic. Conciousness. For me its very obvious that humans became humans by eating psilocybin mushrooms. Mushrooms are the largest organism on earth and has been here for over 500 million years, so life could have been seeded on this planet by mushrooms spores. The psychedelic experience is the origin of all religion, meditation is techniches without any ""tools"". Before Christ there was the Elusian mysteries. I think the first topic to deal with is heal the sick. Educate people about the solution and the real problem. The real problem is us, our egos and the money we use, the systems we serve ect."	0
judging ROMANI gypsies (they are different from Romanians - please understand - different ethnicities) - the people they are talking about, after the group that migrated and started creating problems in that part of Sweden, its like me thinking ALL swedish people are racist idiots, just by looking at this video. Which would be a pile of crap. Romani gypsies, Romanians and Swedish people generally can be really interesting hardworking and even amazing, all with their histories and sometimes, issues. With no hesitation though, racism is always leading to violence, never positive.	0
Are these Muslims fleeing radical Islam or are they bringing it with them to the western world? I hope it is the former.	1
"I think they meant gypsys and not romanians. In Sweden political correctness has changed the word gypsy into ""rom"", because they want to upgrade them from bottom of society. Sweden is more or less like east-Germany, and Sweden democrates are the only opposition. The other 7 political parties all agree that mass-immigration is good for Sweden, although its destroying our country. So, these boys need to study the english language a few years more!"	1

but let's be realistic.. Sweden is already ruined because it moved from nanny state socialism into sudden competitive and money draining EU, at about the same time as it ran out of funds built up since WW2 from selling arms to both sides.. and while it's on its knees suddenly it gets shed loads of immigrants. This has nothing to do with racism:- it just doesn't work economically, no matter how one massages the statistics. And why are people 'refugees' traversing peaceful lands to get here? At that point they are no longer refugees, if they ever were, but economic migrants. There's more to it than that but that's the nutshell version.	1

You know, there's a reason why you Brits don't like immigrants. It's not exactly the most valuable people who leave their country, because they can do well in their homeland, too. Everytime I met my fellow countrymen abroad, I felt ashamed. It's just that, get your facts right before you start bashing others, because not all the immigrants are worthless lazy twats on benefits.

"Very one sided piece indeed. But like everything in life, there are two sides to a story. The arson at asylum facilities and the repulsive quote that drew all the clicks (let's face it) are appalling indeed. But this sort of social convulsion is hardly surprising during such a refugee crisis coupled with large scale terrorism. These are times when the bad guys got inside Europe together with the good ones who genuinely needed help. Everyone is scared and it's only natural that most people will turn against mass immigration under these circumstances. There are other factors such as the loss of identity a country goes through - a country with reduced population at that, which would see its ethnic composition warped, and the economic impact it would have. But for the most part, these people are worried about their country - a free, liberal, modern country with freedom of expression having its identity warped by the ascension of radical, intolerant forms of religion, by people who refuse to integrate and embrace another culture. This is maybe the biggest worry. It struck me how naive the reporter sounded (or maybe she has precognitive powers) when she said ""it has worked in countries like the UK"". Well, has it? Look at some things that happened in Luton not long ago. Let's wait another 20 years and we'll see if it really worked out for the UK."	0

And denying there existents and the racism in Sweden will not help anyone and it will not make them go away!

Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted. The LORD replied, ‚ÄúLook around at the nations; look and be amazed! For I am doing something in your own day, something you wouldn‚Äôt believe even if someone told you about it. I am raising up the Babylonians, a cruel and violent people. They will march across the world and conquer other lands. They are notorious for their cruelty and do whatever they like. Their horses are swifter than cheetahs and fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their charioteers charge from far away. Like eagles, they swoop down to devour their prey. ‚ÄúOn they come, all bent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind, sweeping captives ahead of them like sand. They scoff at kings and princes and scorn all their fortresses. They simply pile ramps of earth against their walls and capture them! They sweep past like the wind and are gone. But they are deeply guilty, for their own strength is their god."""	1

Corinthians 11:3-16 3 But I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ; in turn, the head of a woman is the man; in turn, the head of the Christ is God. 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head shames his head; 5 but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames her head, for it is one and the same as if she were a woman with a shaved head. 6 For if a woman does not cover herself, she should have her hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved, she should be covered. 7 For a man should not have his head covered, as he is God‚Äôs image and glory, but the woman is man‚Äôs glory. 8 For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man. 9 And what is more, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man. 10 That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. 11 Besides, in connection with the Lord, neither is woman separate from man nor is man separate from woman. 12 For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. 13 Judge for yourselves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14 Does not nature itself teach you that long hair is a dishonor to a man, 15 but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her instead of a covering. 16 However, if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom, we have no other, nor do the congregations of God.	0

SD: How shallow understanding you have about the immigration? Look, what this guy said in this video, ''We are dressed up because we want to make good impression and don't want to look like a filthy Romanian.'' You must know that they are ''Europeans'' not from Non-EU background.'' According to the EU rules, you can't send them back to Romania! If you well-dressed doesn't make you any better in terms of ''Education and Knowledge'' perhaps they are more worthy in contemporary society.'' You bigots: ''Get education and knowledge about the rules and broaden the perspective of global citizen rather than talking like an ignorant arrogant idiot.'' Haven't you seen? What the immigrants brought the positive things in this country? 1. Economic growth (Trade between different countries has been accelerated) because of immigration. 2. Immigrants are doing jobs which a lot of people don't want to take rather they are sitting unemployed or taking sickness benefits. 3.Cab and buses drivers are paying taxes and contributing their role the in country's economy not sitting at home and taking benefits. 4. Educated immigrants are playing a vital role in Hospital and pharmaceutical departments. 5.I.T sector is another example where immigrants are not only helping the growth of the well-renowned companies but also bringing the innovative conceptions and ideas. 6.Food and pizza- Restaurants are mostly run by immigrants bringing international cuisine and taste in the country. The list of positive aspects of ''immigration'' goes on & on so don't spread hate and polarize society rather ''help & encourage those who are integrating and are on the way of a progressive life.	0

Without them we could never have taken advantage of the ww2 aftermath were we stood strong in times of destruction all over the west world), and they are hostile to democracy (wanting to restrict policeofficer¬¥s political stand and as well restrict the rights of the free press) .... ............... The biggest role model for this party is Jobbik from Hungaria, a decendant straight down from past Europe`s brown and black history. Its a fine number they did with this video and I get that a story like this sells but dont get fooled from it. Sadly, a part of the Swedish population are ignorant enough to go off on bullshit like this but it does not represent the mainstream will of the Swedish population and however you count, in our last election, 82% of the people told this party to fuck off.	1

"Jane: Again. 12.9%. Not 30%. End of. The rest of the parties refuse to cooperate with the SD (and even SD has broken up with the SDU because the latter are clearly more outspoken and.. ""active""), and rightly so. Normally I wouldn't condone exclusion; these guys are the only exception. They have caused complete cacophony in the Riksdag, voting strategically instead of representatively, against principles stated in their program and what they've spoken about at rallies, and most importantly, against their voters interests -- except for when it comes to immigration. The SD are no politicians, they are populistic activists in expensive suits trying to keep calm, fine-tune their rhetorics, and not start swinging iron pipes around immigrants (again), calling themselves ""the sole opposition"", which they are not. They are a pretty tiresome bunch."	0

I take it, from the general feel of these posts that Swedish people on the whole don't see mass immigration, especially from muslim countries as a problem for Sweden, now or in the future. Looking at things in Sweden from England where we are in turbulence due to the EU strangulation of us and our inability to rid ourselves of those we know are here to force their own agenda by stealth growth and any other means it would seem to be the opposite of that.	0

Common sense is really not common I have come to believe it.Zoran I don't think if a Christian did the same he/she would be referred to as a Terrorist,and more to that where is it written that he is a Muslim?????? Recently in Uganda white ladies that strip dance and equally act porn movies came dressed in hijab with nikab (veil that covers the face and eyes) and were looking for young men who can act porn. Thats what happened and just by the look of their dress code someone would say they were Muslim but actual sense they weren't. So before you judge any one first find out what they truly are cause it's really a shame when you realize that you have hate towards a wrong group. Just think about it	0

For everyone who saying that Sweden the isn't like that for me bla bla bla. First of all SD is the third biggest political parti because the swedish people voted on them to be that so it is a big amount of people who agree with their political views. Second of all try to be realistic we have seen plenty of videos and comments on romainen people and it's not often nice. We even had commercials on the subway about the romainens who begs and how they make Sweden filthy with their presence. With that said I know that not every Swede is like that or thinks that but obviously it's plenty who does so stop being blind to the facts because if u can't see the problem there is no problem for YOU. It doesn't mean the problem doesn't exist..	0

"To suggest it's immigrants' fault, even to agree migration is an issue, is to play into the hands of the propaganda. It's rubbish. The major problem is we're all in a period of economic theft, a downturn in economies where the rich are literally stealing from the poor and Middle classes... these people are looking for someone to blame for their problems and ""poof"" right wing parties appear blaming immigrants."	1

"On February 04, 2013, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, addressed the Duma, (Russian Parliament), and gave a speech about the tensions with minorities in Russia : ""In Russia live Russians. Any minority, from anywhere, if it wants to live in Russia, to work and eat in Russia, should speak Russian, and should respect the Russian laws. If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture. We had better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim minorities are not Russians. The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a five minute standing ovation."	1
