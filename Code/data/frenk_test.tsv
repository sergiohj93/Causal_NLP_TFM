I don't think so John you either are gay or straight. Or you are into both. Either way people are who they are and we should accept everyone. I know I'm 100% straight, if gay marriage is legalised I won't be changing my preference. If this is the push for people to come out of hiding lives then more power to them, everyone deserves true happiness and peace in life	0

Our Creator established rules governing marriage long before governments began regulating the institution. The opening book of the Bible tells us: “A man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24) The Hebrew word “wife,” according to Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words, “connotes one who is a female human being.” Jesus confirmed that those yoked together in marriage should be “male and female.”—Matthew 19:4.	1

Why gays would ever want to get married? Marriage is a religious contract that sanctifies the relationship between a man and a woman among people who witness the event. It is a religious thing, and I still haven't heard about any religion that permits homosexuality.	1
This is such a great idea :'-)	0
"I don't see the problem in the idea. Speaking as lecurer of 16-19 year olds in the subject of health and social care, there is a radical difference between their generation and mine with regards to acceptance (and not just tolerance) of non-hetrosexual cisgender people and issues. I bring it up constantly in my teaching and have a significant number of case study issues that bring up sexuality and gender in younger and older case studies. They are, most of the time, very ""okay"" with it and get quite affronted with inequality. I am of the view that in the future, such an instituation will start to become null void as a ""requirement"" - the future generation will embrace this. But I'm being hopeful."	0

We are indeed stepping back in time. Homophobic and racist attacks are on the increase. People need to feel safe,happy and valued to have a fulfilled life. If it takes places like this for that to be a reality for older people let's welcome it. Perhaps you could turn your attention to challenging the homophobia that makes places like this desirable and necessary instead of focussing on how detrimental you think they might be without looking at the bigger picture.	0
And we would also be extinct sooner if every person of opposite sex had kids, overpopulation. We have enough people on this planet, most gay couples adopt the kids of straight people that didn't want them	0

If you dont like gay marriage then don't marry a gay person. Stop shoving your religion down our throat. Respect.	1
And what if god and the devil are made up things and they do not exist ? Or you have proof that believing in them gives you unquestionable benefits ? So far I see religion as the root of all evil, more people have been killed in the name of god than anything else. Sorry but I am blunt if you want to believe in anything you have the right to believe in ...unicorns if you wish nobody should care. As long as it does't discriminate what other people believe in. Now grow up! Gods are for medieval people who cannot blame themselves for their own failures and misfortunes.	1
Well, that statement too makes you a horrible person	1

Sadly the ones causing all this damage are not the average gay people just wanting to get married.. The terrible crap is coming from a extremist groups pushing for things like genderless children..safe schools.. Loss of parental rights and only being parent 1 and parent 2..and so on.. It's all these groups that are using the marriage equality to slip their sordid stuff into everyone's lives..Especially our children.. But they won't be our children because if you disagree the schools will deem the child mature minded and you will lose your rights to choose.	0

Yes, you can have special homes built for the LBG community. I want homes for people who are interesting and intelligent, don't swear. We can have other homes for Black people, Asian people, disabled people. Lots and lots of homes just tailor made for me and me not forgetting me. We are all human beings whatever our sexual orientation. I suppose it will take many years for the LBG community to have the confidence to accept themselves and not feel the need to keep reminding us of their sexual preferences and orientation. Those who don't accept the LBG community will find it lonely in their old age because they will be in the minority. I'm 73 and hope I never end up in a home. The thought isn't a pleasant one for me and when we are well and fit isn't for anybody. If I do have to then I hope I will be able to enjoy good conversation and laughter with whoever is sitting next to me whatever their sexual orientation and still have the compassion to listen.	0

What does the word Humanity mean? It means to love, to care, to show compassion, to practice and preach helping each other in our emotional and physical times of distress. To show acceptance and respect towards each other as fellow living beings (for all living beings). These essential and natural elements of humanity existed and come to existence much before man made ideas, practices, beliefs and expectations (religions, societies, mythologies, ideologies, etc.) A child of any species first takes birth as a living being, belonging to him/her/it self first and foremost later on the families, societies, communities and ourselves start identifying with something or the other- in most cases it's a clever imposition. This child that takes birth as itself is taking birth as a living being and the only thing it truly belongs to is it's own inner light- inner compassion, inner love and humanity. Today in the USA, Humanity has won over regressive ideas, beliefs, emotions and feelings of hatred, disrespectfulness, segregation and discrimination. Congratulations to us all to be a part of a society and country that believes in 'Inclusion' and not 'exclusion'. We need to understand everything in nature, is Natural! Now that the LGBTQ community has been embraced with open arms and humanity, we should make attempts and take strong steps in providing equality to other minority groups or groups being sidelined- we should open ourselves towards understanding and embracing groups belonging to all skin colors (African Americans, Asians, Caucasians, etc.), genders, mental and physical limitations, animals rights, children's rights, etc. A historical day in the U.S. and the world today.

Fine by me as long as it's not council funded. Very few, if any, gay or for that matter straight clubs are funded by the taxpayer!

It!s a choice, not forcing people into ghettos. Giving them the option to feel safe amongst others. Elderly gay folk have lived in fear of being imprisoned for a long period of their lives for being gay or having sex. Persecution we in the modern world will hopefully never encounter. Why cant they choose to be themselves in such a place rather than having to hide or getting comments like 'i'm not sitting next to that queer' etc in a classic establishment.. if they want to choose to live there let them and give them a ducking break in their twilight years! A chance to relax. Possibly for the first time in their lives .....	0

I disagree people don't just change who they are because it's trendy and if that's the case it ruins the message these good people are trying to relate.

He had a complete different life due to pressure and when it was finally okay for him to be who he was he opened up and was finally free. I want my future children to live in a world that accepts them for whoever they are and they can do everything everyone else can if they are in that position. I personally will never get married until all people can get married.	0

"Carolina, people like you love to try and take the ""oh I use logic and the left just have insults"" line. Would you like to know why everyone is insulting you? Would you even be open to comprehending the motivation? How many conversations do you think we've had, in real life and in the cyber world, about our rights to exist? Conversation about how we want to be treated like everyone else (that is to say, love the ones we love, whether it looks like yours or not, marry who we want to, whether our choice in partner is what YOU and people like you would approve of), or to be able to exist without fear of an individual having real animosity towards us and doing something about it and being surrounded in those moments by people like *you*, who ""don't hate us"" but would be passive enough to keep us marginalized. How many? Have a guess? The point is, your ""science"" is flawed, and we've heard it all before. Your ""logic"" is hopelessly idiotic, and we've heard it all before. Your ""reason"" isn't fully fleshed out at all, and obviously has way more to do with emotion (ironic that, but not unexpected) than anything even remotely reasonable, and we've HEARD it ALL before. But can we convince one such as you if any of that? Mostly, given history, nah. We can't. Cause you're ignorant, and people like you in the past have wanted nothing so much as to stay that way. Final note, a suggestion. If you'd like *not* to be insulted, try having options that aren't garbage. I hear it works wonders."	1

Very good idea, but I think that LGBT people should feel safe wherever they are, why should they have to have places like this. The laws should be robust enough to deal with anyone making life difficult. As a woman with Asperger Syndrome I would love to have a place though where it is disabled women only and I wouldn't get hassle or sexual advances from men. Even though I am hetero, I am not interested in a relationship but have had so many problems with men who live in neighbouring flats. This is very difficult so I would like women only, but why should I have to live apart from the males of society because some want to be difficult. The issue of sexual harassment, especially of disabled women is another thing that should not have to happen.	0

Might not it be that sexuality, if it remains a personal matter, does not require the acceptance or invite the rejection of anyone? If an individual presents their sexuality as a public statement or it is perceived as a challenge, requiring it to be accepted, then of course it might engender the exact opposite response. Most mature adults have an innate respect for the privacy of others and expect the same consideration in return. Put sexuality into the arena and people will voice an opinion	0

Lee, I agree with you entirely. We are human beings. It's about time the heterosexual's came out, then we'd all be on the streets.

There are too many horrible things going on in this world without getting worked up about our sexual orientation. I do draw the line with paedophiles.

"Being gay, or bi, is not a mental illness. If your argument was that gender dysphoria (transgenders) is a mental illness, I'd agree with you, but that still wouldn't mean that it'd be okay to disrupt their lives and take certain rights away from them. Also, I feel like it has to be pointed out, having a mental illness isn't a ""bad"" thing, it's not some insult, it's a harsh reality, a reality that requires some level of care and understanding. If you think picking on the mentally ill is something you should be doing, then I think you might be mentally ill yourself."	0

Everyone has their right to an opinion. I personally do not think voting yes would be a bad thing because it's about equality. What difference does it make to anyone's lives if someone decides to get married or not. I am a straight woman, would my marriage or choice to get married effect any of you? No. No different to people marrying of the same sex. If we say no to this we should be saying no to interracial marriage it's the same thing. Acceptance is key people	0
I think same for both sides - whether you vote Yes or No, its everyones right to have their say, and cast their vote as such, no explanation to anyone is required, all this protesting for and against is just causing a rift in the community, we have enough going on in the world without arguing about this, just go about your business, and send your vote in, don't vote if you dont' want to choose, its also your right	0

It sounds like discrimination to me, like creating a ghetto to isolate people that other people don't want to get involved with. In other countries they used to create hospitals to black people (as if there were any kind of black people), hospitals to white people (as if there were any kind of white people), schools to black children, schools to white children, remember? Is this option any less wrong? Remember: couples are just that: couples. And old folks are just that: old folks, who deserve to be loved and respected. One day, any one of us will be, if we're lucky to get there. Respect them. Being segregated in a home is bad enough. Shame.	0

Initiatives like this one are prejudice. Plain and simple. Not good. Besides things like LGBT are things that are best left in the bedroom. It's no one else s business.

Don't quite understand your reasoning. Are you speaking for yourself or projecting your feeling for a cause. There are many reasons for sadness, loss of a child, a spouse or a partner. I wouldn't want to be in a place where people discriminated against me for say being conservative and voting Brexit but ah, that would be OK wouldn't it. Sorry my best friend is gay and I love gay men. I also feel for transsexual people. I wouldn't like to be in a place where people swore every other word or who were crude but that's just how I feel. I hope I never need to be in an institution but people are lonely from all walks of life not just in one very small section of society. It's people who are important and who they are inside that matters and when you get older you realise that is the only thing that matters.	0

Maybe it's something to do with the vile campaign of abuse run by the 'No' campaigners. Calling people child abusers, lying about what is going to happen if the Equal marriage is achieved.

Then are you not talking about your relationship? That surely requires no need to be accepted or challenged ? Would you do so with a recently bereaved friend ? With a colleague who has just broken with their partner ? Then natural consideration and discretion applies which imposes your lifestyle or sexuality on no one, in this context.

"^^^ what Karyn said. Basically Jane, you totally understand that you would prefer to spend time in an environment where people don't discriminate against you - and so would I. What your first comment failed to understand is that being LGBT is not just about sex, it's about who we love and how we have lived our lives. I don't want myself or anyone else to have to go back into the closet because of fear on old age. Yes, in time attitudes will, are and have changed BUT even if all was perfect I have lived my life surrounded by my LGBT community and I would like to continue to have the chance to do so. We have a shared life experience as a community that will probably be even more valuable to me as I grow older. We make decisions about who we live with when we are adults, why should we have this taken away and treated like children when we are older? I also think many will take issue with you on ""sexuality going down the pan"" when you are old - is that your lived experience or are you projecting your feeling for a cause?"	0

The USA has now confounded its commitment to the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights in particular Article 16 which established marriage as hetrosexual in nature because of its inherent capability to ' found a family' only hetrosexual pairings have this generative capability. The judgement of the US Supreme Court is illogical.	1
Thus, God intended marriage to be a permanent, intimate bond between a man and a woman. Men and women are designed to complement each other so they may be capable of satisfying each other’s emotional and sexual needs and of providing children.	1

Even though California appears on the map in approximately 6th place as the progression of states that legalized same-sex marriage, it is important to note that Gavin Newsome, the mayor of San Francisco 11 years ago, decreed the legalization of same sex marriage for SF which led to many court battles and democratic dialogue which has resulted in today's decision.	0

Interesting to see that the ones here who are the least tolerant are the ones who expect the most tolerance from the rest of the world.	0
51 percent LGBTI could still mean cis-heterosexuals are the largest single group, eg it might happen that 15% were gay men, 15% lesbians, 8%bisexual men, 7% bisexual women, 4 %transgender, 2%intersex - and a whopping 49% heterosexual (say, 30% female and 19% male to take account of sex ratios) - That sounds mighty diverse to me, yet commentators are complaining that heterosexuals are excluded, or that this is a ghetto!	0
call me whatever you like, but i think i have a more balanced education than you and that is obvious. If you want to live your life the way you want, then go right into a cave right in the middle of the antarctica where you will not be able to pollute humanity and when you die, the polar bears will feast on your remains; you and your fellow sodomites should go live in a place where we will not even assume someone like you exist so that you will not be able to pollute the earth and establish the balance which we and your forefathers have struggled to establish by knowing and understanding that those lines must not be crossed. I am not bothered by whatever you say afterall you have no input into civilization except that you keep feeding it with filth just because God has brought about your existence and all you will do is struggle against what He has enjoined the entire humanity to shun. And now that you have decided not to do that, then wait for His response; wait, and it shall come upon you sooner than you think... And for those of you who think God does not exist and that your creation is by coincidence, you too should also wait until your appointed time also elapses and you shall see clearly everything you used to deny. God is very patient and no matter how long you live, you will be called to judgement someday and that fact will not change ever!	1

Yes it does. Being gay does not make sense scientifically because like poles don't attract, same sex couples cannot procreate and the biological make up of both the male and the female sex exclusively gives room for different functionalities. So excluding a particular gender from your life deprives you of basic human needs. I am tired already. I have made my point that I don't support gay marriage, deal with it. Gays say they were born that way, I wonder when the pedophiles will make that same argument. Oh yea, they have started that already. What a shame.	1

This is the sort of bigotry that the proponents of SSM accuse those of us who oppose their view.

Exodus 21: 1-11 1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. 4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. 7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. Judges 11:29-40 29 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 30 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If you give the Ammonites into my hands, 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.” 32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.” 36 “My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. 37 But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.” 38 “You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 39 After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.From this comes the Israelite tradition 40 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.	0

I'm at a loss as to why you're sitting there obsessing about other people's sex lives. Let's discuss yours. I'm actually quite repulsed at the thought of you having sex. Ew!	1
Judges 21:10-24New International Version (NIV) 10 So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children. 11 “This is what you are to do,” they said. “Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin.” 12 They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan. 13 Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon. 14 So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them. 15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. 16 And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 17 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 18 We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ 19 But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” 20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’” 23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 24 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.	0

Thank you Neil for asking this question ! Unlike some people who pounced on me because I expressed my opinion freely although many people totally disagree with gay marriage & supposedly their opinions must be respected too ! Anyhow , homosexuaity is aberration , and homosexual behavior isn't natural for those so oriented . The orientation is a disroder and the behavior is pathological . Sexual preferance is cultural & environmental rather than genetic . There is a broad agreement that genes don't make it & genetic influence at most is minor . Individualistic reactions to random factors are very important . For example , divorce doubles the risk of later homosexuality in children . So social & family paths lead to it & the environment is much more powerful than genes in the development of homosexuality . Here , homosexuals are the victims of environmental problems and they are like patients who should get proper treatment .	1

Unfortunately older people are statistically much more likely to be bigoted when it comes to accepting difference, and at their stage of life they're unlikely to moderate their views either. Remember it was illegal to be gay until 1967; many of today's pensioners will have grown up in the 1940s and 50s when the powers that be would give anyone found engaging in homosexual behaviour the choice of prison, a mental hospital or 'treatment' in the form of chemical castration or sterilisation. Not a happy period in our history.	0

"I work with elderly people and I know many who have had to ""go back in the closet"" on entering a care home, not daring to display pictures of a deceased partner or talk about their previous life. The risk of physical violence is real as dementias often involve a degree of disinhibition."	0
I can't honestly believe this was an issue in the first place. But finally a step forward!!	0
Wrong: as soon as you divide the population: the prejudice has won. It needs educating away: not moving the people away from bigoted views. Imagine if Apartheid was still operating because 'black people need to be kept away from bigoted whites' : would Nelson Mandela have approved? No	0

yes, i'm scared because i know the consequences of this action and no one will be spared. You witness natural disasters all around you, but you heap the blame on global warming instead of you to look back and correct some of the ills you have brought on humanity. You have explanation for everything even when they do not sound convincing. God does not depend on you or what you put forward, but the lines have always been there and now that you have decided to cross them one after the other, you will then have to be reminded who owns everything and who also drew those lines afterall you cannot say you have not been warned. My little submission here is just a small warning and a reminder not just to you, but to the entire world so that when we are finally consumed by our senseless and avoidable iniquities, we will know and understand how much we have wronged our souls. We are planning and God is planning and, obviously, God is the better planner...we, including you, shall all see...	1

That still means that about 10% of society is receiving 51% of provision. Fine if we actually had a comprehensive care system but in effect it will lead to people being discriminated against based on gender\sexuality.	0
So now more things besides race, religion to divide and fight over. We all have our choice to but it's seems more we are being told how to think and vote and have society descend more into violence and separation and segregation. Social decay	0
If you want gay marriage don't go to some political rally and harass 'no' supporters. Just tick 'yes' on the form. Do the same thing if you don't want it. Keep your opinion to yourself and tick whatever box you like. There's no need for all these people out there behaving like children from both camps	0

"don't bring pedophiles into that, get your facts straight. Gay people give legal consent to having a relationship, children can not do so with adults. That's why it's a crime. How is it an argument that poles don't attract? What does that have to do with actual people? Do you mean to say that all straight people have to or will procreate? Because not everyone does and many of them choose not to, others simply can't. The purpose of marriage or even sex is not simply giving birth to children. Gay people are not deprived of any ""basic human needs"". Name one human need gay people are deprived of, there is none."	0

Jane and Lee. There's a couple of things. 1. People's sexual habits are quite a small part of their sexuality. There is a history, a culture, a vocabulary all born from oppression which is part of our individual and collective identity as an LGBT community. When you reduce someones identity to sex you objectify them and begin to dehumanise them. It's a common mistake and one that many LGBT people make as well, but try to think of this articles in terms of people's experience rather than their sex lives. 2. There is a common oppressive discourse that gay people (men specifically) are peadophiles. I know you're not suggesting this in your reference to peadophilia but even using the term in the same sentence implies a connection. That is oppressive, if you don't want to offend LGBT people stop referring to peadophiles in any context wen talking about LGBT people. 3. Straight people don't need to come out, everyone presumes your straight, be thankful for this. Coming out is scary and sometimes has a negative result for the person doing the coming out. 4. Getting on with our lives and living and let living is not about ignoring difference, it's about celebrating diversity. So pretending homophobia doesn't exist and 'we are all in it together' is difficult for people that have experienced oppression. Ya'll have a good day now xx	0

"Why are these migrants above following the process and procedures? Where are the controls to ensure proper following of these regulations? Why do these migrants get to demand where they can ""settle?"" I understand that some are fleeing; however, most are looking for a better life from their refugee camps in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, etc. But there is an order and process that they need to understand and follow. If that basic concept is not understood, then they are going to have a hard time settling anywhere. Demanding to enter, not registering, throwing rubbish everywhere, damaging property, fighting, protesting, going on a hunger strike, etc. is not going to help their situation. Act a little bit more respectful and humble, then maybe people would be more willing to assist."	1

I am afraid it is not BBC only.... most western media is doing exactly the same. Huffington post, Sky news and the list goes on. One sided, misleading information was everywhere for an entire week Hungary was on the front page of all the UK newspapers but other issues like arson attacks on refugee camps in Germany, people sleeping on the street in Austria, ( just a side note both of these countries had more time to prepare for the influx of migrants....) violent behaviour towards police were not reported.Mass manipulation at its best..... But looking at the comments I am glad to see that most people cannot be mislead and started to realise how the media is trying to influence them. Also well done for explaining what is happening in Hungary, without going down to a certain level. As I said in my other comments it will be interesting to see how those who refuse to register will be integrated when they cannot respect the first law about border control.....	1

What I do really find problematic is that among the refugees are also people from places like Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Not exactly war zones, so clearly only here as 'fortune seekers'. That is not wrong in itself but there are other channels for economic migrants.	1

I can't understand why Europe is breaking its neck to take in these migrants you know nothing about them they are going unchecked you have no idea who's coming in ! Why are you all rushing to help these people Muslins hate us our way of life and culture if the situation was reversed these people would do NOTHING for us there are other nationalities in there these should be sent straight back to where they came from WAKE UP EUROPE seal the border end of story !!!these people come here throwing their weight around making demands Europe owes them NOTHING ! And all these fit men should be send back and be fighting for their own country ! Having just watched The Sunday Politics show Heidi Alexander of Labour said we should be taking thousands more Muslims what planet is she living on ??? The UK is FULL we can't even house our present population schools and hospitals are bursting at the seams and this woman makes these stupid remarks ! But then I guess she'd rather house Muslims than her fellow citizens !	1

As part of the EU, Croatia should register the migrants, and after that they can go forward.

"Wars In the Middle East Have Created More Terrorists!! Security experts including both conservatives and liberals in America agree that waging war in the Middle East weakens International security and increases terrorism. Killing innocent civilians is one of the main things which increases terrorism. Starting wars against states which do not pose an imminent threat to International security increases the threat of terrorism because: One of the principal causes of terrorism is injuries to people and families. The Iraq war wasn’t even fought to combat terrorism. And Al Qaeda wasn’t even in Iraq until the U.S. invaded that country. So the widespread program of war on terror and torture under the Bush administration didn’t help.

"Well, wherever I'm from, please justify how I'm racist? That's a nice argument coming from someone trying to muddy the waters between refugees and ""illegal immigrants"", I note with interest you haven't taken issue with my comments about Bulgarians... You'll note I also said ""most Europeans"" and compared refugees with professional beggars... you really should be careful about overreaction. For your information I'm an internationalist and see no reason for any borders (incidentally, neither do the rich or corporations, so why should the poor suffer them?) Yet again, you need a lesson in terminology and are missing the concept of refugee status. Immigrants are usually given indefinite leave to remain or a contractual period of time, refugees (such as the syrians coming to canada) will be given temporary leave to remain, and will as such be expected to return home as/when Syria is ""safe"". Syrians are not safe from war in Turkey, or have you missed the stories of multiple suicide bombings and revenge army attacks? Plus there's the point Turkey has as many refugees as the EU in a much smaller area... they're pushing on the Christian and Kurdish refugees. It's not schizophrenic, ""refugee"" is a legal term and Germany & Sweden have offered to take all Syrianss fleeing war. Hence, despite the legalities of entering Greece, as soon as they're registered they are legally refugees... until then let's say asylum seekers, as no one fleeing war or persecution shouldbe branded ""illegal"". As for Greece, Olga, sorry while I was attempting to prise a reaction from mr anonymous teacher there, i have nothing against Greeks, Bulgarians or Romanians per se, many Europeans do, and Bulgaria has elected a rather right-wing govt... Mr greek, As for dealing with these refugees, I do every week at work, and they're a friendly bunch that I've so far met... Vienna racist? :-D so the ""fluchtlinge wilkommen"" movement hasn't been reported then? While we're on the subject of history/historical places, shall we touch on the reasons the middle east is a shit storm now? Post WW1 the allies carved up the ottoman empire and drew lines in the earth to force people together in some areas where they hated each other, and apart in others where they potentially threatened western interests.... Cyprus is the largest testament to the active part the Greeks played in that theatre. Meanwhile, my family were enjoying a civil war in the Irish free state... easy to chuckaround labels, isn't it? So try not to label refugees in Europe ""illegal"" and maybe others won't point out how close countries close to your heart are skating to disaster."	1

Dear BBC News For that crisis Croatia is not guilty... agreement was that Croatia can be transit country, everyone around us agree. What Hungary, Slovenia and Austria done? Close border... what Hungary and Slovenia expect of our Prime Minister Milanovic and of Croatia? To be fools for them?... They angry because we partially close our border but they close their borders with wire and walls! They can close but we can't!!!!!! What the hell they were thinking? Croatia can't handle with hundreds of thousands refugees, we can't hold them here because they want to go on north... Most of Croatians don't have something to eat but we help as much as we can. So... push Slovenia, Austria and Hungary to open their borders and let refugees to go where they want. They just can't stuck in Croatia. If no one want them, why they think that refugees can and must stay in Croatia!!!!!!!! Are we again become someone else's fool? If countries around us will close their borders for real, we also will close our Croatian border.	1

Nice to see that normal discussion is possible. Hopefully, this will be the case on the next summit of EU Council. The refugees should be transported as soon as possible to the country that invited them (Germany). The problem needs to be resolved politically on the EU level, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS.	0
No, we don't think that Hungary is expert in anything, except in building fences and spreading xenophobia. The problem originated from the lack of proper control at border crossing between Turkey and Greece. When the migrants have entered the EU there, it is only a matter of time when will they end where they want and there is no way to get them back to Syria now. Army and fences will solve nothing. Only a plan on the EU level with the exact quotas for each country can solve the problem. Nationalism, racism, and widespread xenophobia, as promoted by PM Orban will make things only worst.	1

The population of Europe is in the hundreds of millions, a few million are coming and about half of them will be accepted. They may have numbers in their own countries but here they are still outnumbered. It's like when people say 'native British' will become a minority in the UK, well considering only about 15% of the population is non-white I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, and even if it did, white British still have all the power and most of the wealth. The fears are unfounded. And the fact they're coming for safety and benefits makes them a threat? They're not a threat, they're just making up for our declining birth rate.	0

They only show snippets on TV, leading you to believe it's all about the women and kids. Wrong! This migrant situation is 75 % young men, going to Europe with a purpose in mind. They threw in a few woman and kids to make it look better. They were suppose to stop at the borders to have their papers checked, lots of them burned their passports. They threw the food they were given to the ground. These are Not refugees. These are Migrants intent on taking Europe. Germany should have never offered refuge to the mass exodus. All borders should be shut. How many Isis are in this group? The countries should only keep the women and kids plus the fathers, all the young men should be returned. Not that many Syrians but lots of other countries that are not even involved in fighting.	1

My point is simply, you can't blame everyone else for the mess, that your politicians and the rotten system created in the first place and how they've handled it so far.

"the comments which come from brains of advocates of murder in the name of ""our country"" and ""our problems"" ignore the fact that development and migration are intrinsically related, that the capitalist system inherently develops unevenly, that the British regime is part and parcel of economic policies imposed on poor countries through various means (IMF, World Bank, support of dictatorships, freedom of their corporations to plunder, etc, etc), that the same regimes have played a significant role in aborting the attempt of the same people fleeing ""their countries"" in overthrowing the oppressive system at home (see the so-called Arab Spring, the elections, the NGOs, etc) all in order to maintain the status quo. Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism."	1
Olga- sorry, but Greek people are to blame for Greece's mess, maybe not Tsipras and his supporters but the ones who didn't pay taxes or who sponged while on govt jobs... it was in the constitution that no one could be sacked from a govt job? Ridiculous. While I have some sympathy with the very young, the poor and pensioners in Greece... I don't with anyone who took part in electing govts between 1998 and 2008... Anyhow... Mr Greek Canadian, wow, Canada is taking 25,000 now a liberal govt has been elected... background checks are being done on people with no documents? Good luck with that. A refugee is someone with legal status defining them as a refugee. So Canada will accept REFUGEES. As for me, I'm British living in Austria, I am a MIGRANT to you, an IMMIGRANT to Austrians and an EMMIGRANT to Brits. As for Egyptians, Libyans and Palestinians, there are many recent arrivals in the EU, your facts are out... Syria had one of the biggest Palestinian refugee camps outside of the occupied territories. And suggestions that the media and NGOs are colluding to drive a hidden agenda is a conspiracy theory...	1

Agnes Toma, people never like hearing the truth. here is the US it was similar with the South American refugees that where coming (and still are) in scores and the media kept showing children, but not the parents who were abandoning them, throwning these children over the fenses (literally) to forcibly gain entrance into the country. So 7k are placed in my city and state & the crime is immeasurable. Child killings, torture & abductions are higher than ever. Heroin & needle deali dealing is everywhere. Muggings, home invasions and school violence is uncontrollable and domestic violence, well its all day everyday. All this started within a month after the placement of the refugees into the US and 18 months after their placement is way at all just really started to tear down and it's just become a war zone in the state of Massachusetts. The people don't want to believe that these things happen and that people who illegally push their way in or force their way into a country are somehow good and decent and loving and caring and want to make a better life for themselves. It's just not true.	1

Not really. There's 2.5 million that entered a Greece of a 10 million population in a very short year and a half, with a much as half a million arriving in the last few months spine, accounting for 1/4th of its population all on small islands with towns half that of the size of Moncton. That's like saying by analogy 10 million people came to Canada all within a few months in the smallest of towns. If that had happened here, you'd be crying like a petty spoiled whiner that you are for not being able to drive through the streets. So stop being naive. This is as much a crisis for the illegal immigrants as it is for those locals whose lives they are destroying. You have it easy, and you pick and choose sides too easily based on your preconceived notions. There's utter chaos in these circumstances and nothing is cut and dry. What is more, there's evidence these people are being urged to immigrate into Europe instead of dispersing in the surrounding vicinity of their country that is safe and where they are welcome and where they don't have to travel for 1800 km and pay smugglers 5 thousands euros per head to get to Europe when they're not even running away from danger any longer. Worse yet, countries like UAE, which are Muslim, wealthier than Germany and Greece and Italy and France combined, and a mere 200 km away from Syria have closed their borders to their Muslim brothers. To give you a sense of how irrationally wild it is that they specifically want to come to Greece, get this: Iraq is roughly the same distance: 1890 km from Greece. Where are all the Iraqis from the war there? What about all the Palestinians? They are closer. What about all the Egyptians? They could have just skipped over the sea onto Crete when there was war in their country, but hardly anyone came. What about people from Jordan, they are closer too. Where are they? Libyans didn't come to Greece either. So what's up with Syrians? They are neither the first nor the last to have war. What's the deal with this mass exodus of only males? When the war in Bosnia took place, none came to Greece and they are much much closer by a few hundred km. When the war in Kosovo broke out, no one came either nor dispersed into Europe. When the war in Ukraine came, hardly any mass migration took place. When the war in Yugoslavia took place that created FYROM and the such, hardly anyone moved about yet again. The scenario with Syrians is a first in recent history. Don't be so naive. All these men are draft dodgers too. They should be fighting for their country as they are able bodied, young and healthy. Who will rebuild their nation. At best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilizing both Syria and Europe. Start doubting the news they feed you for a change and ask yourself questions at all times.	1
The Military Industrial complex, the Central Banks and corruption from people like Hillary and Obama among all of their accomplices are to blame.

Once the people are given a reason to have to pack up and leave their country through no fault if their own ..where they know only that life and are comfortable with it...is it not acceptable that they search for a place to settle until they find that same feeling. If you dont want people coming to your country then tell your respective governments to stop invading or assist invading other countries for dubious and sometimes false reasons. No bombs. .no regugees it's as simple as that . One thing to bear in mind is that the earth belongs to everybody. ..borders are man made. It is purely by chance ....good luck or bad luck...on where we are born ...it is only by chance that someone can be commenting on a refugee when it's only a chance happening at conception that its not them . Its nit immigrants or refugees that you should be attacking its yoyr respective governments who run and control YOUR LIVES.	1

I understand your point of view. However, excuse me for saying this, but you don't have to deal with nearly as much influx as we do. You get about 400 people a day, we get 3000-8000 a day. There's a bit of a difference there. Yes, it's great that you shelter them, we did too, but they revolted and refused to register according to EU law. And again, excuse me for pointing this out, but what you do doesn't really help the EU. You don't stop them, you just let them through and all of them will flood the UK eventually. Let's be realistic here, most of them are not refugees, they're just looking for a better life. It's great, but Europe's benefits system will collapse under the pressure if we let millions in. There's a much better life in America for example, still i'm not gonna go there, be agressive and demand my rights, while I don't fulfill my obligations.	1

It's sad that those people shown in the video hold such extreme beliefs. They were too sheltered and they have a false belief that their views are the only views. How they acted was inappropriate. That being said, there is another side to this religion. I have seen that side as well. To ignore that side is ignorance itself. It's where Islam converges with Western beliefs. The result from that is actually very calm. Anyone who is like those in the video are in the wrong, I agree. We don't need those people. It causes chaos. But anyone who only focuses on that side is just as wrong. Muslim values can be compatible with Western values. You just have never seen it, or perhaps don't want to, but I have.	0

We anticipated not more then 1500 migrants per day. Within the first 24 hours more 17000 refugees came. But this is irrelevant. This problem can be solved not within the EU, but only in the Middle East. All NATO countries should assemble and send serious and decisive military force on the Middle East. Full scale military intervention against ISIS is what can save EU, not closing borders and shooting refugees. We need to start with serious actions against terrorist and stop building walls between us.	0

Immigration is fine, too much of it isn't, no controls over it isn't. We have to educate our kids, look after our sick and provide services...this country is like a party with an unlimited guest list...you need to know the numbers and limit them to what you can cope with without the population suffering. The EU started out as a trade agreement between countries who were roughly equal, a common market to help them all. Now it's a bloated monster that accepts countries who take much more from it than they can ever contribute, where the population sees the original member states as Disneyland compared to their own and obviously a lot want to move. They can struggle in a village in Bulgaria or move here and get more in benefits than they could earn back home, and a very nice house compared to their own. With no contribution required to the national pot at all. I never see people on benefits move from here to other EU countries, why do you think that may be?	1

What happens when they get to Europe? Denmark, for example: Every year 29% of asylum seekers commit a crime. 34.5% of rapes are committed by muslims, despite being 4% of the population. 28% of prison inmates are muslim. After 4 years, 87% of syrians are unemployed. 9 groups are more criminal than the average. 8 of them are muslim. Even corrected for socio-economics. So in reality it is much worse. Overall more than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Even counting those who have been here for decades. Somalis have an unemployoment rate of over 80% In Sweden, rapes are up 1500%. But don't worry, not being called racist is preferable to accepting all of this.	1

I'm saying that closing the borders and setting up walls doesn't solve the problem. The problem is as follows: 1. Migrants are fleeing from middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel; 4. Hungary build walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece. Where they registered there? No! EU law? Is there anywhere in the EU law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? No. And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. In the light of my points 1 to 4, all refugees heading for Germany should stay in Croatia and Serbia, because Hungary decided to build walls. Croatia is not acting in accordance with the law simply because Greece and Hungary decided to breach it first. You have no right invoking the law when you are breaching law also.	0

Looking back I remember going shopping for fruit and veg to the green grocers, for meat to the butchers. and for clothes to the clothes shop, for a tv or radio we went to the electrical shop. All these retailers got their products from many different sources all negotiating the prices and selling at their own price, i used to go from shop to shop and see and brows the produces and prices. Then came the supermarkets who started off selling foods, then clothes, then electrical, then medication, then insurances, then banking... Etc, etc.... Now we have the hated controlling Tesco and such like with stores not just in our country buy around the globe. They control the prices the farmers charge, the prices the clothing manufactures charge, the prices the electrical manufactures charge and so on and in turn they control what you pay and buy and how you buy and how you pay. Using Tesco as an example of one large organisation that changed the way every one lived and shopped and took away the individuality and freedom and choice from people and controlling everyone like sheep. TESCO... EU.... Can you see the pattern. Its always then the case and always will be where the few riches people in the world who are control and power hungry.

Muslims are convinced of the perfection contained in their religion that encompasses all the aspects of life and hold Christians and Jews as inferior, imperfect believers. That feeling of superiority is not confirmed by the kind of life they live in Europe. This creates massive frustration, hostility towards their European hosts and a reaction of becoming even more radical. The Muslims of Europe are generally against integration not to speak of assimilation. There might be a few exceptions but these confirm the general rule: Muslims do not approve of the Western World.	1

We need to stop letting all and sundry into the UK and stop giving immigrants benefits as soon as they arrive. I don't mind people coming to this country from other countries as long as they have the money to fund themselves over here. If we went to another country we would have to have enough money to live for at least 5 years and wouldn't get any benefits from those countries either. If we didn't have the money then we wouldn't get in it's as simple as that. ALSO we need to add boundaries like if they have a criminal record no way would they get in, if they don't have the job specifications they wouldn't get in also that they would get NO benefits whatsoever for a minimum of 5 years (like Australia) and then you would only get benefits after the 5 year point if you have been working for those 5 years and you get basic benefits at that point and the longer you have worked the more you would be entitled too. If we brought in all those stipulations I would be fine with whoever came into this country as then I would know that they are not a drain on our economy. We are too nice to other minorities in this country and forget about our own people and their needs. We need to put our own people first and the other minorities second. ALSO we need to stop giving them monies for their children that are not even in this country also!!!!! EVERY minority that comes to this country should not be entitled to any free NHS, NO money from DSS, NO free housing etc they are the ones wanting to come to this country it's not as if we are begging them to come here so they can claim benefits it is their choice and most come to this country (NOT ALL) only want to come to the UK because of everything they get when they arrive. If we stopped handing out everything to them and gave them nothing you can bet probably 80% of those that want to come over here would not then want to come to this country as they wouldn't get all the handouts then and it is the handouts that they are loving and entice them here x	1

I realise that I look at things dfferently to others so here's my humble thoughts ... another way of looking at things. I am a mental health clinician and have contact with asylum seekers. I also see the struggles they have. These people want their home lands and their families, they don't want to be westernised and their culture made irrelevant. Many also suffer from PTSD and suffer on a daily basis. I had one man who was suicidal because he was unable to provide for his family in his home country and he could not contact family in UN camps apart from one member whom he was told would not be leaving the camp. This man cannot fit into a foreign society and do all he needs to to do this successfully when he cannot cope with his immense loss. IMHO I sincerely think we need to stop looking at these situations from our own points of reference and look at them from their perspective. What do they want and need. It's not being displaced and moved to foreign lands with little to no family. You see, cultures outside of western influence appear to value family relationships much more than we do. Look around us at our neighbours - the only extended families are those immigrants who could afford to come her and wanted to. Instead of putting a bandage on a haemorrhage, why don't we fix the problem. Instead of spending all that money to resettle people all around the world, why don't governments join together to despose those in power and causing this crisis. It wold make more sense to get rid of the problem and let people live in their country with their culture and family. I have much more thought on this but this is the gist of it. At the end of the day we westerners do what we would want, maybe we should ask what they want and need. cheers	0

A top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' 'Throughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused with hatred toward Muslims. They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility, so they look for fertility in our midst,' Infowarsreports. 'We will give them fertility. We will breed children with them, because we shall conquer their countries.'	1
Justin Lewis check again the document you quoted from. This is what it says about the DUTIES OF REFUGEES: The obligations refugees must meet in the country of asylum.

In particular, refugees must refrain from any acts that jeopardize the safety, security or public order of communities or countries of asylum.	0

Now I changed some worlds ... better .	0
Just to clarify I am not muslim so this is not MY religion. I have had the chance to live in Iraq (half my life), UAE and the UK so I have tiptoed into both worlds ‘us vs them’. Delina: i think the most important thing you have to question is whether muslims believe that these things you mentioned apply today or whether they apply at all. 1. The whole muhammad marrying Aysha at the age of 9 is debated heavily within the muslim community itself. Some say she wasn’t 9. Even if she was we need to remember that we are talking about 1,400 years ago where there are numerous cases of such things happening within that region. Most importantly, do muslims marry 9 year olds. Rarely. I’ve only heard of cases in Egypt and Saudi. So muslims do not agree with this and it rarely occurs. 2. Nearly all muslims believe that the whole slavery thing is misinterpreted. People interpret it as during war when you come across women do not make them the untouchables and that you should marry them if you want (marriage in the quran requires both consents) and treat them equally. With regards to other slaves, muslims believe that their prophet brought a lot of new rights to salves, changing the roman slavery rules. In addition, a lot of slaves were freed. A lot of the things I have read confirm this. 3. The whole marrying 4 i think was there to spread Islam. I have never come across anyone in my life that has married more than 1 and tbh it only happens in some societies like Saudia Arabia. Nearly all muslims marry 1 person. So again applicable then and not now. 4.Women rights. The whole covering your self completely is simply incorrect. Quran requires you to be modest and not for full out covering. It’s more of a culture thing (or should i say a tribal thing) plus people used to wear it for protection from the sand. I am not joking when I say this but during my 13 years in Baghdad i saw less burkas than in my 3 years in London. In the society I lived in, all my friends' muslim moms went to uni, had jobs and lived equally to men. Within the same families you can find women covering their hair and some that don't. Different interpretation of modesty. This is in Iraq, UAE and the UK. Saudi Arabia is not how the majority of muslim women live and really does not represent Islam. FGM for example again only happens in some societies and not across the muslim world. In fact its mostly an african thing and happens a lot in non-muslim countries. 5. Your statement that muslims have only brought misery to the west is a bit extreme. you have put Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Whabasim, Ahmadeyia, Druze and many others all in one group. Muslim immigration has worked wonderfully in some situations and haven’t worked in other situations. This depends on a lot of factors such as the people coming to the west, the people receiving the immigrants, the programs in place to connect both. For examples, there are so so many muslims in the NHS. If we are going through the route of blaming the whole group then the middle east can say the same about the west. The west has only brought misery to the middle east, from the Sykes-Picot agreement, to the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, to supporting Saddam, supporting Al qaeda against the russions, illegally occupying Iraq, supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, giving weapons to Qaddafi and then taking him out and supporting countries with extreme ideologies. How many dictators have the west supported? Should we block all the west from entering the middle east. Should we build walls around every country in the world. So the misconception people have with Islam is to do with the Quran. Do muslims apply certain verses to their everyday life or do they think that some verses only apply to the past with some parts being story telling. The quran is in arabic, written 1,400 years ago, so are we interpreting the quran correctly? I am sure how things were said 1400 years ago is different to how we speak now. In my experience, most of the muslims i know, and I know a lot given that i used to live in Iraq and the UAE, agree that some versers are not applicable today or they interpret those verses differently.

This sudden exodus of migrants into Europe means a lot of cultural and political and religious implications. Analogy suggests Europe shall become an Islamic state in coming hundred years or so just because of rising population of migrants which to me seems a kind of TROJAN HORSE.	1

Too many want to immigrate. Eg Afghanis. Your war is mostly over there are legal ways like every other person to seek permission. Just showing up does not bestow a right on you, follow the rules. Same for others if you've been given refugee status but don't like the country where you e been given it use the proper means to immigrate. Don't just show up. Also take pride in your hosts country and clean up your bloody Rubbish. I'm all for helping the elderly, children and mothers of REAL refugees but the others bugger off and do it legally. Remember like with any immigration process not all are accepted. So stop just showing up.	1

I don't think the threat to Europe is going to be from refugees coming in from Iraq or Syria. If ISIS manages to blow something up in the UK it will be a British or another EU national who will be carrying out these activities. I would assume that any refugee coming in the country would have some tight surveillance on them. What ISIS wants is division because that works in their favour. The more division the easier it is to convince people that there is a big difference between us and them. The more hate crime the more the propaganda will work. So what we can do is show how ridicilous ISIS and other radical groups are. A school program will have to be included in school to teach muslims and non-muslims how groups like ISIS are at crossroads with Islamic teachings. The majority of people killed by ISIS are muslim and they are burning muslim town after town in Syria. Also programs outside school are needed to educate muslims and non-muslims about Islam and to clarify certain scriptures that are causing confusing. Such programs have already started but of course we need to see more. Muslims have been a lot more active in explaining to others about Islam after recent events. So yes education is key.	0
"Well Will Moreton I don't think there's much conspiracy other than what's flat out under our nose here. I'm neither ""anti-accepting-refugee"" nor ""anti-accepting-immigrant"". I'm ""anti-accepting-illegal-immigrant"" and ""anti-arbitrarily-labeling-illegal-immigrants-as-refugees"". To give you an example: we're bringing 25,000 Syrians into Canada and I'm quite happy about that. The most important thing though is that they will enter legally, with proper checks and naturalization through immigration authorities. So even though the media are having their little jamboree orgasm clasping on the term ""refugees"" into Canada (LOL), they are in veritable truth LEGAL IMMIGRANTS in this case, nonetheless; and whose tragic circumstances justify expedient, albeit legal, immigration should they please to do so. Most importantly, they are NOT seeking refuge into Canada away from war if they are departing from Turkey, unless they are air lifted or ferried straight from Syria, into Canada. In other words, they are NOT refugees even in the case of Canada. Do you find the term ""refugee"" sexier or something compared to ""immigrant""? because the term"" refugee"" applies only in specific contexts and circumstances. Does it connote more compassion in your view or something? Because I find it's being used as a blanket statement to force illegal immigration as something desirable and normal, which it shouldn't. So what exactly is it that you find is being implied as ""conspiracy""?"	1

Daily Mail (London) reports that a top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem claiming Europe was only welcoming refugees as a new source of labour. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' Birth rates are far higher in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most migrants are coming from.The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, 'And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.' To move to a new land in order to bring Islam is considered a meritorious GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless. These migrants cannot be compared to WWII refugees, for they were Europeans and they had no hidden agenda either to propagate their religion or to indulge in terrorist activities, as Atta & Co., did on 9/11 after enjoying everything in the West.	1

barring them from entering Germany and Austria??? I'm sorry but you are totally mislead by UK media. Germany and Austria / the EU still insist on Hungary and Slovenia keeping the Schengen border and they introduced border control as well. When Hungary let the migrants pass to Austria it was because Germany offered to let them all in temporarily. They can still push them all back to the country they register, by law. Based on the fact that less than half are actually refugees it would mean 100-150 thousand this year for Hungary alone. If we do not register them, EU can say the Schengen border is in Austria and they re-introduce strict control, leaving Hungary to accommodate them while they wait. There is no good way out of this for us but at least some factual reporting would do in the meantime.	0

Hungary is handling it correctly, but Mad Merkel totally messed it up in creating a stampede and EU needs to do more to keep them nearer their border by improving facilities & supplies to persuade them NOT to travel to EU because it will be fine for them where they are now in Turkey and other neighboring Islamic States that have already setup Refugee camps for them. WHAT REALLY IS NEEDED IS A FULL SCALE WAR AGAINST ISIS WITHIN SYRIA & IRAQ, and once done all those so called migrants & refugees can be sent directly back to their country of origin. This will avoid another major recession due to the EU has no jobs for them, and therefore they will remain for years on State benefits while being feed, sheltered, educated and given some spending money which will destroy the social welfare system completely! ALSO, the fact that we don't know how many ISIS members & staunch supporters of them have now or will soon be infiltrating the EU & US, as many of the ones arriving have no form of identification to confirm whom they are! This is a massive financial & security disaster, and I am glad that Hungary has seen the writing on the wall regarding that fact to prevent them entering the country - Good on Hungary!	1

And exactly how easy do you believe is to control this tragic situation even if you have money? See at the map our islands and all the Aegean!

Ah the refugee vs migrant debate has this nation split right down the middle with 2 petitions tied in terms of signatures.

Thanks for your comment and I partially agree with you. I am also glad to see that a conversation is possible even if we have different views. There may be a law against a fence which I dont know about but I doubt that there is. If I am wrong and there is why is there a fence in Calais? If there is no law then Hungary didnt breach the law migrants can still enter the border and go through registration. Prior to this I was also thinking that the problem is in Greece but looking at the situation in Hungary and they sheer amount of people I can see why the fragile Greek economy cannot protect its borders and register people. To be honest they needed help well before this happened. And yes, the fence is not an answer on the long term and I dont think it will be up if the situation can be controlled in any other more sensible ways. However, people break through polce lines and it is physicaly impossible to establlish border control without it. You will soon see that people enter your country getting into Croatian citizens gardens and blocking train stations and motorways and making it impossible for people to go to work for example. Also what is really sad that Hungary has been criticised by Croatia that we were not prepared and Croatia will handle the situation better and look what happened! I still hope that a common solution will be found and neighbourhing countries will not turn on each other.

The migrants always use babies or little children as shields - should I believe to your version? The behaviour of Hungary is disgraceful. In italy we had migrants for so many years. Every week they come by boats, we shelter them and don't make walls.Many of them die in the water, ordinary people run in the water to save them. We have lot of controversies in ur nation cos many people don't want them to come, but while they land , and are in need, there is nothing else to do then shelter them with humanity, and this is what people in Lampedusa do. Hungarians know it very well as they were migrants htemselves during the period of their need back in the revolution in the 50s. Over 200,000 of them escaped looking for shelter in the western countries and now that few thousands are in need, they build a wall. Look at ho the hungarians were sheltered at that time. Short of memory? http://67.69.104.76:84/pinetreeline/metz/otherm2/otherm2-16b.html	0

Eszter - I will paraphrase a (very long) response I posted on Gergely Dian's comment thread.... Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe. 1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered. 2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full. 3) With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in... thus pushing the problem further back down the line. The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia. So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden. If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law. The solution I proposed was let those already moving go to Germany and register, and ensure those in camps or those leaving Syria stay in the camps and register. The UN will then be able to oversee their rights are upheld (shelter and food - even if that means camps in Germany, Austria etc.), or that the refugees are resettled as appropriate. However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution, and the refugees are able, and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity. {As it happens, the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }	0

"Yeah and people will frezze to death here. Thats also a problem. We are 9 milion people in Sweden. We take in 10 000 refugees every week. USA a country who has over 300 milion people, will ""maybe"" take in 10 000 on 1 year. Shame on them."	1
A muslim man rapes a woman and its cause for collective punishment? Tell me, how can a country improve its 'shithole' status when its being bombed consistently or interfered with for decades? How can they improve the rights of their citizens when they are struggling to meet their basic needs. These are not hard concepts Ryan nor are they so simplistic like you have suggested.	0

So who are our friends outside the EU? The Americans despise us but want our soldiers as cannon fodder. The Africans hate us because of Empire - who can blame them. India is interested in the USA and China. China is interested in India and the USA, though we might be a useful little colony in the future. South America hates us because they all side with Argentina. The old white Commonwealth countries are building their own regional alliances. Middle Eastern countries know we are only interested in their oil and pay for it only because we are no longer strong enough to steal it. So our future outside the EU will be to do a trade deal with Rockall and Antarctica	0
Well Michael Lovell they will not close the borders and well keep coming to cleanse the world from the haters such as you	1
We don't even know who these children are. They don't have any, or reliable, papers. They could be orphans taken along to provide just the sort of cover needed to create sympathy. 70 % of the people storming the EU are able bodied men who shoul be fighting for and protecting their homeland. Traditional refugees are women and children...not men. So they have abandoned their countries, abandoned, who knows how many women, children and elderly to fend for themselves. Cowards or potential terrorists?	1

The result of not taking quotas sending refugees to Dachau.................Cameron and Orban are you not even slightly ashamed? I am as an European Citizen.

I agree. What did we all expect from a bunch of individuals most of whom failed spectacularly to achieve anything in politics in their own countries? MEPs are second rate politicians - and they are being given increasing powers over the sovereignty of individual countries (now referred to as 'member states'!). Added to this, our respective governments are being influenced by a biased media who are only reporting one side of the story because they just love a bit of sensationalism.	1
All of them? You are using the internet to type your ill informed views why not use it to google some truth? Because if you did you would find that the majority of refugees are in Lebanon and Turkey. How about countries that supported the wars and their allies take some of the victims of their war?	1
Yip, that's why they're running away from their war torn countries. To colonise the west. Not because it's too dangerous to travel to work now.	1

Oana, also I know many Romanians and Bulgarians, also migrants/expatriates from those countries living in the rest of the EU, who are sympathetic to the Syrian refugees, but the current Bulgarian govt is about as unsympathetic as it's possible to be... they're throwing them in prison and blocking crossings. Orban has declared himself against multiculturalism... which the Roma have known for a long time...	1
"But here in Hungary we can't share ANY burden like that either, the minimal salary here is only about 400 USD!!! People with some good certificates (those who has the chance to study at all!) can earn more then this, but this country is just not enough wealthy to give these ""migrants"" enough benefits, this country is enough european and 1000 years old, christian and an amazing culture, but our authorities say just like you all could read above, 80% of these migrants are not even syrian! They protested loudly here in the heart of our capital which was lived even by the Roman Empire, that they want to go to Germany, because here it'""s like Guantanamo !!! So if I scream and shout enough loud that I want to go to England, and I act like a hoard, will I be invited to London? I agree helping people escaping from war, but most of these people are NOT escaping from any war. Many from Pakistan, from African countries even."	1
"Typically English to say. Germany was forced to stop singing ""Deutschland über alles"" but when will the UK be forced to stop singing ""Britannia Rules the Waves""?

If anyone is fascist, it's the UK which refuses to cooperate within the EU properly and pretends that it's giving away its OWN money. No, mate, you stole that wealth from your empire and now you pretend its yours. The least you can do is help the rest of Europe with that enormous wealth which you stole. Even your crown jewels were stolen from India!"	1
"If you're gonna use the ""what about those who bomb people and scream in your religions name"". I say this: Christians who live in peace are CLOSER to the title of ""muslim"" than these bombers can ever be. You wanna know why they're strapping a bomb around their waist? It's because there are western governments that have bombed their houses, broken families (members dying) and knowledge being wasted (because they spend more time fighting you than reading a book). In the past, the prophet and his friends fought because they defended. There are people out there, who proudly stand as muslims and protect their country from being destroyed from terrorists (The west AND the bombers). Why should they be marked as stupid or ignorant or a terrorist? I live in a country where there's a party that's the second largest. They speak ill about anyone. immigrants, women, religious, those who rebel. They stand proudly for what they speak yet say that they know how to save our country (kinda like D.T) but they don't. They wear fancy suits and speak in a lovely manner but their purpose is loud and clear everytime and yet people still believe that they are right. Islam was beautiful. it shed light to those who were oppressed, abused, hated. Now there are those who abuse its name just to get what they want. Giving it a bad name when they don't even know what it's been through. SO JUST STOP. Muslims don't make Islam better. Islam makes muslims better. I rest my case..."	0
Such misery man is bringing on mankind. Although I feel for them, they ought to go through the proper channels. The UN ought to supply more staff and police the refugee camps for safety . Then as people say, Muslims sent to Muslim countries and Christians to Christian ones then there can be no further persecutions as I am sure there will be. No lol it is too serious TMA	0
who are you kidding?	1
so you suggest that we don't close the border with Serbia? Which means no border control and no obligation of EU law? And it is ok to pass through any countries they like? If we tolerate this behaviour of not respecting EU law how are we going to integrate people and asking them to respect our law? Or can they pick which rule they obey and which they don't?	0

But the migrants try to get to Austria. Austria is safe. But migrants try to get to Germany. Germany is safe. But migrants try to get to Sweden. These people are NOT refugees. Refugees are people who get to a safe country and ASK for help; which the country then either supplies if it can, or ASKS other countries to supply if it cannot (which is where we come in). People who arrive in a safe country and decide its not quite what they are after, and so march through safe countries to find one they do want, are NOT refugees. They are economic migrants.	1
"As with any issue today, public attitudes regarding Immigration and the EU are being determined by a mixture of general dumbing down and a total lack of attention span. A superficial, knee-jerk prejudice is easy to communicate in the snappy soudbites that the media and twitter has accustomed us to. Responding to those ignorant and misleading messages requires background, knowledge and information and a reasoned, articulated argument. People are just too lazy to read complicated messages these days, so they are naturally attracted to simplistic slogans and soundbites that convince them that issues are simple and the solutions equally simple. There is no such thing as a simple political issue and any politician who promises a ""cure-all"" like leaving the EU is a quack, however much he/she may say the things you like to hear. Anyone who believes that an exit from the EU will resolve more problems than it will create is as self-deluded as they are manipulated. The UK is an attractive country for immigrants because it presents a successful image to the world. The reality is that the UK is no longer a Political or economic power that is strong enough to stand on its own in relation to the massive interests of the US, China or for that matter the EU. The UK, outside the EU would fast become a political irrelevance on the Internatiional scene. Absurdly, it's exactly those naiive and anachronistic flag-waving patriots fighting for 'Britishness' that are least in touch with British culture today. I'm proud to be British, but my pride is linked to our Multi-ethnic culture as a whole and not some lame royal regalia or bowler-hat and pinstripe tourist nonsense. Our Multicultural society is one the few positive consequences of our colonial past, and Britain has every reason to be proud of having achieved the enriched society it has today. Our multicultural society s a far more accurate and rich expression of our Island's historical heritage than red telephone boxes and roast beef. By all means seal yourself off from the world and watch the country slide into irrelevance and economic meltdown, but that will be a consequence the UK would be entirely responsible for and not something you can lay at the door of exploited and marginalized immigrants."	0

You have compared the Hungarian refugees from 1956 to the Syrian refugees. You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference. But it seems to me that at the present only we (Europeans) act tolerantly while they stick to their rigid customs. It is hard to imagine any real co-operation with them if they do not change their attitude.	1

Garett Mullan in reply A refugee is someone who enters the first safe country and ask's for asylum , they have gone past the refugee status and are moving on forcibly through Europe using force when stopped, a lot have no papers or passport, which makes them illegal or put together illegal Migrants, Europe in the best will in the world needs to look and see who is entering their country countries can you tell me how many Islamic state are mixed in with the people forcing their way into Europe No.........it is estimated 800,000 are going to be at the borders of Germany and 300,000 will not even pass refugee status so what do you think they may be? holiday makers as for the Holocaust that only took 7% of the 800,000 thats around 11,428.half of a person around an invading army then	1

The pro eu comments from the guardian useful idiots is the exact opposite of what the British public feel, just like the left wing extremist Britain hating art critic who slagged off the poppy tribute, completely opposite to the British publics sentiments.

"HOW DARE YOU? How dare you? Greeks didn't create any war in the middle east. They haven't in the least bit, neither directly nor indirectly instigated any of the problems facing Syria. Yet Greeks are carrying almost the entire burden of illegal immigration into Europe almost singlehandedly, when in fact the very countries responsible for the crisis in Syria and the middle East in general, including Britain where you're from, which has been a global cancer with its imperialism are doing nothing. Greece hasn't caused this flux of immigrants. Yet Greece is handling almost all of them. But Britain has had a significant involvement in the middle east and Syria to say the least. I think it's only fair to take in a few ""refugees"" from Lesvos island and move them to Britain, to turn your village in Britain into something like you argue Greece deserves (for its politicians being idiots, and causing the crisis, in your logic). I'm glad you told the world what an horrible racist you are by finding an arbitrary excuse based on my name alone to be spewing your hate about Greeks when we're talking about Syrian immigrants and Syrian refugees being incorrectly labeled as such by the media who incorrectly use the terms interchangeably. There are Greeks who have it just as bad, if not worse than some Syrians who can afford 5000 euros to pay their smuggler into Greece, as they live in abject poverty in the streets of Athens, eating from garbage bins and rendered homeless through no fault of their own. You should go and see, instead of speaking out of your puckered British asshole: the nation that has fucked this planet time and again. How dare you, you despicable bigoted subhuman?"	1
"You are experiencing the same issue I see on these threads, countless times per news item. Namely people read something, or hear something and repeat it as fact, when it is only an opinion. When asked to justify it they can't, because the proof doesn't exist.

"Eszter - I agree with you 100%, in the ideal world. But let's say everyone agrees to implement 100% border control at midnight tonight - with the numbers we are seeing, countries in eastern Europe will struggle to give the aid that is needed (even if the refugees were to behave and abide by the law). That is why I said about letting the ones moving get to Germany - so the burden falls on the country, or countries that can handle it, until the UN takes over. As for genuine refugees vs illegal immigrants... that is another reason to pass the problem on to Germany, because eastern Europe couldn't undertake the burden of repatriating the illegals. The only way to fix the problem is stop the flow at source, and let the rest get to somewhere better equipped. Your second concern (about knowing who is who, and where they are) is a major issue for Europe that I feel will come back to haunt Europe. I believe Hungary have already arrested at least one member of ISIS, so how many more have just disappeared - and even without the terrorist threat, how many ""undesirables"" or criminals have taken the opportunity to simply vanish? As I said before the situation descended into a great big cluster fk - compassion is one thing, but it looks like western Europe totally lost it's mind, and didn't think a single thing through."	1

3. It gave blacks and women rights = It can't get any WESTERN than this. At a time when women were treated worse than animals and slaves were beaten for just a TINY mistake, the prophet shed some light to these people. let me ask you something: If you are to be the in one of the RICHEST tribes in the land but your family believes in something that you just don't feel is you. You have a different opinion and tell those who suffer from YOUR family that there is something better that will make them more valuable but that they need to sacrifice their belongings to a more simple life , what are the odds that those who believe would be sick, poor, old, slaves and women?

First of all these people are not migrants.....they are missionaries of you know who...! It's quite simple.....don't let anyone enter in their respective country. There are so many humanitarian grounds to think about......with in few days of entering the refugees hosted ISIS flags in Germany. So decide it for your self...are they refugees or part of a new Jihad planed by ISIS. (The best way to get penetration in Europe)	1
Well it's a mostly Muslim tower block, in a mostly Muslim area, so it's kind of expected they look after their own.

They don't want to give way to media emotional blackmail, and the incredibly outrageous biased news reporting. People need to wake up to what monster they are playing with here. There is nothing wrong with wanting to protect and maintain your own country and culture. There is enough barbaric bloodshed going on in the middle east. Only a brain dead fool would want to import it into their own country.	1

"To begin with I totally agreed that the UK should accept some refugees but now - seeing all the fighting and aggression and the sheer volume of ""refugees"" I don't think we should keep allowing them in. We are taking 20,000 over the next five years. The EU now needs to stand up and make other countries ""do their bit"" and take refugees too ! It's NOT an EU problem - they all want to get to the EU - it'll cripple us all if they do and could well change everything we stand for and value - tradition wise and security wise !"	1
Any country should have controls over its borders. We should look at similar island nations like Japan and implement the same controls to avoid importing terrorists and benefit seekers.	1
"Oh i know this place and I am lebanese this place is built for lebanese not for refugees and by the way it is in Jbeil and I know it very well when i was searching for a studio they asked me if I want to rent it and please notice ""I AM LEBANESE"" So it is not as people try to make Lebanon appear. If there are 5% of the people who treat others wrong this does not apply to all lebanese for regarding Lebanon's distance we have Armenian refugees that became Lebanese already, Palestinian refugees soon to get their id, iraqi refugees and Syrian refugees so due to our really small distance we have no places... I prefer you people who like to generalize come down from your kingdom and start sharing what you have :) why don't you take some refugees or help us with some money so we can build them what you wish they have? If we do not build to ourselves how can we build to others excuse me? No hospitality better than Lebanon and historically it is known in our tradition so please do not sit there judging what you do not even know. And thank you."	0

Saudi Arabia has a huge refugee camp that can literally fit hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, yet it sits empty. It's all for show.

EU is supposed to give to Greece 474 million euros in the next 5 years. Until now they haven't given not even 1/10 of this amount ,most countries haven't even sent immigration officers that they have agreed in an EU summit 2-3 months ago. Also the government can't spend any money without EU concession. And about the corrupted governments in 80% of the scandals a German company was behind bribing those bastard politicians.	1
Shauny... can you explain WHY they should use the word refugee? If you look at the UN definitions, a refugee is a person fleeing somewhere in fear of their lives, and a migrant is someone moving to improve their quality of life (usually to improve their economic position). Now, if we assume we are talking only about the syrians, and not the other people moving through Europe, they are undoubtedly refugees when they leave Syria. However, they then choose NOT to register in the UN camps, or with the authorities of the bordering countries, and they move on. That is when they become migrants - leaving one safe place for another to improve their quality of life. Whether they are entitled to or not is a different issue, I am merely asking why you think they should be called refugees regardless of where they are at the time...	0

The responsibility to handle the refugees should be divided in accordance to those same nations that caused the crises through their warmongering in the first place. The greater the effort they put into warfare in middle eastern nations, the greater the number they should be required to take in. This should obviously include the US, as most would then be shipped here. We can house them all in DC. maybe they can help us get rid of the terrorists currently occupying that city.	1

Islam gave women rights just like Saudi Arabia allowed them to vote to give them the illusion of rights too. Women in Muslim countries have no rights like women do in the west.

I have read Quran and its misogyny is transparent. Also women rights are non existent in Muslim countries because they have religious laws, not secular laws. There is a lot of ex Muslim women who were raised in Islam and say the same thing. Also, you have completely ignored my question again.	1

"Sir, I doubt that people are more accepting of Syrian refugees that Bulgarians and Romanians. Begging is a very big annoying, unpleasant and ultimately harassing thing but you are mistaken if you think that the refugees will integrate quick and without any issues and be forever grateful to their European Savior. They are faced with bureaucracy right now, procedures and this makes them mad and feeling disregarded. They have some high expectations and a very different perception of Europe and what Europe has to offer. The idea that once the refugees together with their families arrive in Austria, Germany, etc they will have a job in a matter of hours/days is unrealistic. The reality of the matter is that the whole process takes time, and after what they have endured they don't have any more patience which is understandable.Contrary to what most of people think most of the refugees will despise their ""European Savior"" if we keep ignoring some core issues and congratulating ourselves for being so accepting."	1

PC you need to read-up on your history, most of what you post, is utter nonsense, obviously from generations of a family who despise the Conservatives. Mining, BSC, Unions, perhaps!!!! HM contributes more to this Nation, than she receives. £280m goes into the Treasury coffers, in return she receives £37m. Plus tourism, restaurants, hotels, transport, all benefit from the Sovereign. Immigration is a 'poison chalice' yes there are too many allowed into this Country, NHS, Education, Welfare, infrastructure, are all bursting at the seams. On the other hand, would the Welfare scroungers, fill the positions that they are willing to do.? The answer is quite clearly NO NO NO. This Country needs to take a tough stance on future immigrants, including those from Asia, who pose an even bigger threat. Make it an unattractive proposition. No benefits, no housing. Why do you think they are queuing-up in Calais? They are by-passing other Countries to seek refuge in this soft-touch Nation. Cameron needs to inform Merkel, to mind her own b---business.

I like how you say that EVERY MUSLIM COUNTRY represents islam. for gods sake, they have different cultures you know. THEY are the reason why these countries are a mess. Afghanistan is not Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is not Egypt. Somalia is not Turkey. There is a difference but they share islam as a faith. Still, they have caused many violations that have clearly been condemned by the religion but NO ONE seems to care if someone opens it and shoves it towards media and those who did the act. oh wait...don't muslims from all over the world do that?	0
It's a muslim invasion. Saudi Arabia has the money, space and a massive air conditioned tent city able to hold them all. Once we are over run with muslims they can start out voting us in council elections then bigger elections and before you know it we will be living in a muslim country and the women will all be forced to wear burkas and all the disgusting things that go on in muslim countries will be going on in European countries. beheadings and stonings en-mass. hasn't Boris Johnson just been replaced by a muslim as mayor of London? And I read that that dead boy on the beach in turkey was staged, and the 'refugees' have been having weapons delivered to them. It's a planned invasion and we need to seal the borders and send those that are here back. Let the Arab nations deal with their own	1
For the west to be longsighted and not support extremists groups at the sake of making money or short term goals. ISIS would not be anywhere as powerful as it is today if western powers didn't illegally occupy iraq and completely remove all army personnel and councillors. Borders were left open and many ex-soldiers started working with al qaeda to fight the occupation. Al qaeda was non existant during Saddam's time. It simply wasn't there. ISIS is an offshoot of al qaeda. The west supported and financed al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. Also the west's attempt of removing bashar by supplying weapons to the ''moderate rebels'' in Syria was just stupid. A lot of these weapons ended up with ISIS making them stronger. We all know that the west supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is the UK's biggest purchaser of weapons. The less powerful ISIS and Al Qaeda are the less propaganda there is to brainwash people with. There are many factors leading to the mess we are in and the west's middle east policy is one factor.	1

Simon, I can see where you are comming from and there is a lot I can agree with you on. I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.	1
We need to make our own laws firstly because half the EU laws and regs are borderline insane, and,more importantly we should only have immigration where its needed eg. 20,000 jobs going needed to be filled by immigrant workers, so send 20,000 instead of 300,000 its that simple lol	0

Pamela, but unfortunately those guest workers never left, and I have heard some pretty negative stories about the Turks from my foreign exchange students, who mostly are still on the bottom rung of the ladder because they will not assimilate nor do they value education.

Problem is they will go to all the countries them start trying to change them. They will push their religious beliefs on everyone and demand people do what they want.

"I agree that some contries are better equipeed at dealing with the situation but looking at the news from Germany they are seem to struggle at this point too. Anyway, my point is that a clear message should be sent that only refugees can go to Germany and the EU which may discourage people to embark on this journey at all. If they see that somehow getting to the EU will enable them to go to Germany they will try their luck. As much as I am aware of a train was stopped many times in Germany by pulling the emergency handle and migrants jumpped off the train and disappeared. How can you make sure that they will go back then? I still think that we can bring the ""equipment"" to the people rather than the people to the equipment. Costs less time and money. I am not sure if it was a really a terrorist or not so I cannot comment on that, I heard about it but I am really not sure how reliable the info is. There is certainly a risk and that is why I am saying stop everyone where they are and find out there and then. If the EU is one unit it doesn't matter so the funds and resources can go to where the problem is. I also think that Germany should take more responisbilty about the situation due to the message that was sent out (funnily enough that was a rather vague statment which now can be altered according to the situation - but lets move on about it) Than it is possible to talk about quotas and numbers. On Verdans point what I can see is that the communication between member states are really poor, everyone included, and this issue is highlighted it big time."	0

1. There are 49 countries where the majority of people are Muslim. There are only 7 countries that have a major portion of their laws under Sharia: Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Brunei. So the majority of muslim countries do not have Sharia law and those that do do not have full out Sharia. 2. There is no one type of muslim. Same as there is no one type of Jew, Christian or Atheist. There are moderates, liberals and radicals. Pretty much all the ground troops fighting ISIS are muslim and nearly all the people that ISIS kills are muslim. As shown above, the majority of countries do not have Sharia law so the majority of muslims are not radicals. So there is no one group of muslims. Same as the fact that there is no one group of christians. Not all christians are part of the KKK. Although all KKK members are Christian. 3. The west have been at the forefront of giving power to the radicals. They financed and supported al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. They illegal occupied iraq, a country that had no presence of al qaeda or ISIS before the invasion, putting in policies that banned pretty much the army, councillors and police officers allowing for al qaeda to enter Iraq and cause havoc. The west continually supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest purchasers of western weapons and therefore they are the untouchables. The middle east has payed the price for this. There are many factors that have resulted in the mess were are in and the West's middle east policy is one of them. 4. Most religious books contain practices that may not be applicable to our society. For example within the old testament: Murder Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT) Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB) Sex Slaves - check out Exodus 21:7-11 NLT The majority of all muslims believe that some parts of the quran are specific to past events and should not be applied to today. A lot is story telling. The same thing applies to Christianity and Judaism. So, similar to most Jews and Christians, Muslims also live their lives not adhering to these things. There are 2.8bn muslims. If they all thought that suicide bombing is a duty against the infidels then our world wouldn't exist and there would only be 100% muslim countries with no minorities. I can only imagine what would happen if the Christian Spanish inquisition or the crusades occurred today and was picked up by social media and shown to us. It would cause a shitsorm and Christians would be the target of hate groups. All we would see and talk about is Christian terrorism.	0
Not really. There was that taxi driver that turned out to be a Sikh, that's about it. Then they went and protested people marching against terrorism. Their true intentions are clear.	1
as i saw till now ppl from uk are so open with this and i can't understand why they don't take all the migrants? And yeah eastern europe doesn't need those migrants	1
Close borders, send the ones already here back then get out of EU. If not the white European will soon b a memory, the only difference will be they will be fighting here instead. Wait tho, maybe the cowards will run back to Syria then!	1
Quick... Bomb it.	0
The images are disturbing; but the media can distort, slant and twist stories. Europe has a crisis in its hands. It's easy for all of us in the outside world to judge and make decisions, sitting on a sofa, in front of a TV. In fact, only the countries directly affected by these events, know what they can handle. How are they going provide food, clothes, schooling and medical care to these many people? What puzzles me the most is why the wealthy Arab countries aren't helping and offering to take in these people	1

David, I wish I knew. If I had that knowledge I would definitely share it. They are sheltered and misguided, their women uneducated, their men brought up with ideas that they are superior. How does one deal with any brainwashed group? Way before this issue came to Europe, I grew up seeing it in Turkey. Yes, Turkey is not run by Sharia law but there are still extreme individuals who take it into their own hands. The only thing I've seen work, and very slowly, is just to start educating those children. Have the next generation more knowledgeable about the world.	1
Quite often we have to pay the price for other people's stupid decisions. I see no due diligence being demonstrated by Merkel or the EU parliamentarian aristocrats. The only due diligence now is for EU countries to reinstate passport control at their borders. There is a big difference between fear and reasonable caution.	1

Wow am I watching the BBC? Dateline London someone actually going off script and giving a sensible view not the usual Pravda left wing opinion and he's also got the gaul to stay calm as they try to shout him down.

If this continues I might even start watching it again regularly, no get real I know in my heart it won't change and all the good work done by the guy from Conservative Home will be forgotten.	1

Your deluded if you think this is all some grand plan to take over Europe with refugees. The concept isn't hard to understand, as a refugee are you going to choose a shit deal with no prospects in a country close to home? Or if we are being honest, we would all choose to go with the best possible option for a better life in certain European countries. It isn't some Trojan Horse masterplan to take over, it is just common sense.	0

Britain is not against working migration (it has welcomed and promoted it for many years) but benefit unproductive migration, hence the need to make reforms to the UK and EU abused migration regulation and make Britain's permanence beneficial and not another EU broken benefit state that won't be able to care for none internally on internationally	0
Hmmmm... I am getting cross... I have just read that Syria launched air attacks against IS, or whatever they call themselves. My question is WHY haven't Syria formed an ARMY...??? This is an important issue because lots of their young men are running away... WHY are they not in an army...? WHY should they look for a 'better life' in Europe (and the UK) when we had to fight for our way of life, with death and injury affecting our families...??? Now with US and Russia involved, it seems to me that WW3 is approaching... I SUGGEST that Europe (and the UK) accept women, with their children, as refugees. All other people should be regarded as illegal immigrants and sent to Syria, no matter where their origin, to fight in their army to achieve a 'better life' for themselves...	1
Delfina Most of them settled in Lebanon? You make it sound so nice. 70% of the 1m Syrian refugees in Lebanon live below the poverty line. Jordan and Lebanon are tiny tiny countries. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52893#.Vnue_UK0m20 This is not how you describe settled darling. 36% of those entering Europe are children and women. But in your eyes even muslim children are violent. We all know that there are more men entering because the route to europe is risky with lots of people dying. But not to worry, in the UK the figures will be much better as they will be taking families from the camps themselves so the minority will be men.	0

Getting fed up with the 'violin' act. 10% are probably genuine unfortunately the rest are after cherry picking a different life. I'd have more compassion if they adhered to the countries laws and complied with them. Why won't people register because they have things to hide. If I travel somewhere abroad I have to comply. This is a world problem. Investment needed in the camps around Syria to give people healthcare and education. We have to be realistic Europe cannot absorb whole countries.	1

"A terrorist cannot be muslim, a muslim cannot be a terrorist. ISIS clearly does NOT represent Islam. “…if any one killed a person, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind; and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole of mankind…” - The Holy Quran (Chapter Five, Verse 32).""

The EU has already granted Greece 474 mil. for the refugees for precisely that reason. And it doesn't even take a lot of money to at least make an effort. Why not inform yourself of how much of an effort to treat the people decently and at east try to get that chaos more organized. SHould be feasible, with the EU money, shouldn't it? Unless of course it dwindles away surprisingly on it's way to those it is suposed to help. Those really helping are the private people, the state and the administration aren't much bothered.	1

It is compatible with Western beliefs. I am proof of that. My parents are both Muslim and I was born and raised in the USA. I was taught to read the Quran and to be a good person. My dad wasn't too pleased with Quran school and he had a good reason. He didn't want me brainwashed into extreme Islam. I see why, those people are horrible and their ideals are best left for the stone age. My dad believed in the freedom of every being. My dad never told my mom what to do. My mom doesn't cover and she works full time, not a house wife. I was taught to be independent, taught how to drive by my dad, was encouraged to work and to make my own decisions. I respect other people's beliefs and sexualities. My friends consist of many different backgrounds and beliefs. I'm friends with an atheist, bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender. I even enjoy conversations with this very religious Christian. To me they aren't those labels, they are just people whom I enjoy being with. My sister goes to a Christian University and has made friends with a nun. Everyone should have the right to belive what they want and no one should force any believe on them. So tell me, am I not western enough? You can't look at life through horse blinders. There are bad and good people everywhere. To belive elsewise makes you just as bad as those extremist because they too are looking at life through horse blinders.	0

The hungarians are correct it is an invasion, and it is aided and abbeted by the BBC and Sky news . If you watch either of them you would think it was all women and children , the reality is that it is 95% men and very few of them are actually Syrian . We need to defend our borders and keep these people out or we will pay a heavy price in blood.	1

Propaganda? Sure. Educate yourself about the IS properly before you write such rubbish. Look what they do in Syria (and Iraq etc), the Paris attacks were nothing against it. Those who flee (at least 99% of them) are normal people who fear for their and their family's life. Not terrorists. And not people who spread propaganda, all they want is a life without fear. Be happy that you have this priviledge.	1

CaMORON and his racist party would sell their souls to hang on to power. They care not one iota about the country, more about how history will document them. They are actually encouraging racisim. Even Miliband is as bad, if not worse, when he has posted on his FB page that he is worried about the increase of anti semitism in the country - and not a word about the demonisation of immigrants whipping up unrest and hate. There appears to be a dangerous increase in racism and this has been stirred up by the political parties and the right wing media purely for political gains. God help this country - it is becoming toxic.	1
"I know someone will think this is racist, but why can't they just leave Europe for the Whites? EVERY major race on the planet has their own part of the world, they call home. The Latinos have all of Mexico and Central and South America. The Blacks have most of the Caribbean islands and African countries. The Arabs have most of North Africa and the Arabian Penninsula. The Indian people have South Asia. The ""Asians"" as we call them here, have all of eastern Asia, and the Polynesians have most of the Pacific islands. Why can't the WHITES have one part of the world for themselves? Whites don't flock in hoards to regions where other races are the majority. We need to preserve our culture and our land. Please. Let us have at least ONE continent for ourselves. i don't mind a few, but not so many. Seriously, I visited Copenhagen and felt like I was in the Middle East. This is ridiculous. PLEASE EUROPE, fight to preserve your culture and values. LEAVE EUROPE FOR THE WHITES!"	1
The EU is bringing Europe to the brink. The Union is designed to maintain peace in Europe....but it's policy of forced diversity is starting to tear the continent apart. Only a small percentage of those traveling to the west are Syrian...and only a percentage of those are families. Just because Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium, Holland and Britain wishes to commit cultural and ethnic suicide by allowing uncontrolled numbers of non-White, non-Christian people in to their country....doesn't mean the rest of Europe has to. I hope we are seeing the end of this Marxist federal nightmare that we are being forced into....but I see dark times ahead!!	1

"EU is a failing club. Definitely worth leaving. I know I will be voting to leave EU! That is absolutely what my thoughts were and still are, handing out ""sweets"" to these so called refugees will only continue to encourage millions of them moving into Europe and demanding to be housed, fed and clothed!! Can we afford to do that? Well I'm afraid our children, our children's children and so on, may not have free NHS if we take thousands of these people in. They will come in and start popping babies. Schools and hospitals will be overcrowded."	1

We maybe not the best country but we are not stupid! You said rule of EU! Are the closing border with wire by the rule of EU? You forgot that Hungary were transit country and when you close your border and refugees start to come here that all other states close border also!!!! That is not mocking of Croatia? You are mocking with all of us when you close your border. I admire you for that action because I understand why but why you expect of Croatia to do somsone else's job.... Agree was - Croatia transit country! All you around suddenly close your border. Are you register all of them? We can handle with maybe thousands per day not with ten thousand per day. Many of refugees don't want to register and now what? The same news we read from Hungary and now we are guilty? Why? Why you close your border and we can't? Are you all aware that we have 300 thousands of unemployed, many thousands who work and not receive a sallary, many homeless and now, in a great european spirit you all expect of us to take care of hundreds of thousands refugees while you made a fun of us with your closed border???? Refugees don't want to stay and don't want to register (we register them first day but after no one wants to register), they want to go north!	1

Well, most of those countries are undemocratically led, in most cases the leaders are good to their people, but in cases such as this one, it also happens that these leaders decide on what to do and the people don't really have much of a say in the matter.	0
I totally agree with you Craig!	0
"For Europeans asking where the women (refugees) are? Most of those young men are here to ""breed"" with your women and take over. That's what they did in each country they colonised. In ""Islamic"" Sharia a Muslim man is allowed to marry Christian & Jewish women and enslave ""athiest"" women to ""breed"" and bring in more Muslim offspring to the world, but a Muslim woman would be an adultress to marry a non-muslim - because a woman (and children) will be under the leadership of the husband, which in this case poses more than one ""Islamic"" dilemma. Muslims led many invasion in the past but they no longer need armes to invade Europe. They just need an army of young men to ""entre"" Europe and that will be it. Next thing ""your women"" will be here fighting their battles and before you know it, they are citizens and their offspring are European by birth. This is not a far future. It takes - with the other tactics employed - just one generation."	1
"Canada has to be careful when receiving them. They have all destroyed their id documents so that they can be accepted as refugees. Don't press our government too much on this issue. ""Nobody is illegal "" is not a good slogan."	1

ISIS has threatened to flood Europe with half a million migrants from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West, it was claimed today. Transcripts of telephone intercepts published in Italy claim to provide evidence that ISIS is threatening to send 500,000 migrants simultaneously out to sea in hundreds of boats in a 'psychological weapon' against Europe if there is military intervention against them in Libya. Many would be at risk of drowning with rescue services unable to cope. But authorities fear that if numbers on this scale arrived, European cities could witness riots.......This was part of a story in an italian newspaper on 18/2/15 and 7 months later it seems to be coming true 😔	1

However, agression is NEVER acceptable!!! I'm sorry that this is acceptable to you. When they'll end up in the UK, you'll see it with your own eyes! Stop making excuses for them, when you live thousands of kilometers away and you're completely clueless! WE ARE HUMAN TOO and we have rights too. Our country turned into a dump, because of all the rubbish they leave behind and they are agressive. Listen to me, very carefully Janine, we will not tolerate this behavior.

1. Islam is the MAIN reason why science is in europe in the first place exists. Most of the scientific books from the past were somehow related to Europe and Asia and then the Roman empire got destroyed, Greek texts were lost (Guess who? religion abused through corrupt christians priests). and what did islam do? simple: It was narrated that Anas bin Mâlik said: The Messenger of Allah said “Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim”. AND: It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “…Whoever follows a path in pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise... This resulted in muslims translating the books they could find about any knowledge to be translated. They see it as a way to enter paradise and to teach the future generations would increase your likelyhood. Europe was pretty much crumbling until the renaissance came and where did they go to read about how to retrieve the knowledge of the greek and roman texts? well, from Istanbul of course, the city that belongs to the muslims. I recommend you watching Crash course if you'd like.	0

"If they were to walk to the USA border, it would be the exact distance Syrians are walking to get to Greece, in fact it would be closer. Imagine NGOs waiting for them at the border to help them ""for their trouble to get to the USA because of their circumstances"". That's the logic of labeling illegal immigrants as refugees. They are perfectly safe in Turkey where they initially find refuge from the war. When they leave Turkey to go to Europe, they are no longer running away from danger but are in search of a better life. That's understandable, but illegal nonetheless. For went should the Syrians be given priority for an exception to their desire for illegal immigration and not want other of the 2.5 billion people on this planet with similar or worse circumstances?"	1
check the news before you say something 20-30% of them are refugees only most of them came from countries where there is no war and pass through safe countries where there is no war. Not hating outsiders but want to know who is who. Why is that an inhumane sin? Would you let strangers in your own house who won't tell you who they are?

The migrants don't want to stay in Croatia even though they were given food and shelter! 20.000 people in 2 days entered a 4 mln country that already has 300.000 unemployed. Are you normal?

Give people the vote let them decide, at the very least I think we need to have the EU reformed root and branch. Since the auditors refuse to sign off the accounts does it not suggest there are issues. The government need to deal with the immigration issue, people who arrive to work and pay their taxes should be welcomed. Illegals benefit tourists, beggars etc should be deported. Those people who live here and seem to be adverse to working should be, unless illness or family responsibilities prevent it, should be forced into work. If migrants can come here and find work locals should be able to as well.	0

Cynthia, no you are correct - but when you responded the way you did to the terrorist threat, we supported you. Now fast forward a few years, and we have OUR citizens being killed on our streets, and on the beach when they are on holiday. We also have terrorists being recruited from within our own country - plotting against us, and going to Syria to fight for ISIS. With ISIS openingly declaring they will send more terrorists to Europe disguised as refugees, are you still saying we should keep our borders open? I can't fly to LAX without security checks, so I can't see that Syrians would be able to.. so why should it be any different for Europe than the US? (Of course, I fully expect you to ignore these questions, the same as every other time a yank comments on these threads does... but that proves the point really - you can talk a good game, but have nothing to back it up).	1
I guess we can thank the Labour party for all this world crisis and migrant problems. I hope corbyn and Co can house some in their homes? Yeah right!	1

"As Croatia collapsed within 1 day, again Hungary has to solve the chaos. Now we must build up the fence till the Slovenian border as we did it at border of Serbia. Croatia is carrying the illegal immigrants to Hungary (as Serbia did it before) - daily more than 10 000 immigrants. Croatia doesn't defend its border, they don't deserve the membership of the EU. That's the Southern Slav mentality. (when they should do something, they don't do anything - as it happened so many times in the history) Hungary is the only country that keeps the rule of Schengen. We register and supply the illegal immigrants. We ensure that there isn't humanitarian catastrophie. The European Union let us again alone. It takes daily 1 billion Hungarian forint but we don't get any support from the EU. As the fence will be ready from Serbia to Slovenia, Hungary closes the border again and nobody will enter to us. Approximately 2000 Hungarian soldiers are building the fence and 3000 police officers look after the order. It would be nice if you reader from England, Germany, France and from all the countries of the world, never forget which country was the only tower against the illegal muslim horde! Don't believe to your press that is constantly crying for the ""refuggess""! They are constantly lying to you day to day! Greetings from Hungary!"	1
Hy. I am a hungarian and please, lets clear something. Hungary receive the migrants for months (4000-11 000 people per day). We give them water, food (which they dash against our policemans), blankets, clothes, medicines, toys. We also showed the disney tale for the kids in the East-Railway Station. Many hungarian voluntaries and policemans help them, but unfortunately nobody see these pictures in west. Yes, the government built a fence, because the migrants arrived ILLEGAL through the GREEN BORDER. The authorities could’t check them and catch the smugglers. Besides, the migrants trampled down the fieldlands, so they caused serious damages for the farmers. Please, don’t forget, the registration points are still OPEN. However, the migrants don’t want register. They don’t give fingerprint and many of them throw away their papers. They would like to go Germany immediately without any papers and become angry when they have to wait a few hours (or a day) for the next train. This situation cause the most conflicts with the police. Greece, Italy, Croatia don’t try register the migrants (maybe Slovenia do something). Now, IT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Hungary is the single country, which keep the schengen’ s rules. This is our responsibility. Currently, Croatia transport thousands of migrants with buses to the hungarian border. Yes, we take over them. We need to work TOGETHER. Please, stop blame Hungary for everything. Thank you. :)	1
Ok, so it's about me being German? As for the greek crisis, I am not very happy about how Greece has been treated and I think there should be a debt cut. Then again, your elected governments have failed you spectatcuarly and are ultimately to blame for decades of mismanagment. How about you take it up with your government for failing to correctly tax the rich and actually seeing the state gets the money and put an end to the fakelaki system and the vastly overblown beaureaucracy amongst other things when the shit really started to hit the fan? And can you seriously expect the taxpayers of the EU states to keep coughing up money for Greece without reform? Just go on as before? As for the refugees, more help needs to come from both the EU and the UNHCR, but the local administration also have to step up their game.	1

"I agree Vedran, but that is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted out and run through all your neighbours corn fields... My real solution would be to make the refugees do what they are supposed to do. The countries in eastern Europe, such as Croatia, Hungary etc are now in a no-win situation. If they follow international law, they are required to register every refugee as they cross the border. Once registered the relevant State assumes responsibilities for their general welfare - but the refugee is not then free to move on somewhere ""better"", so the State is potentially stuck with a crisis of it's own. However, the UN foresaw that problem way back in the day, and came up with resettlement - where nations agree to legally relocate refugees away from the over-burdened countries - opening up the option of transfer to USA, Australia etc. Now, ideally this would have happened before that poor boy got washed up on the beach, but it didn't - instead the world reacted, Merkel opened her mouth to invite everyone in, and then slammed the door in their faces. Now, back to the no-win situation facing eastern Europe... they should close their borders and register people - but then the world says they are inhumane. Even the UN are criticising them for (apparently) doing the right thing. They can't send the refugees back down the line to Turkey, and the next country up the line won't let them in... So whereas my post was in jest, some of it was actually the most realistic solution ... let the ""refugees"" currently on the move get to the countries equipped to process them but then do everything as it should have been done in the first place, namely register them and resettle as necessary (or call on the UN to help with the financial burden of camps etc.) At the same time stop the initial migration away from the official camps in bordering countries. And above all, remember if they want to be thought of as refugees, the plan should be to get them all back home to syria again... not building a new permanent life somewhere ""better""."	0
I've just read that 4 out of 5 are not from Syria yet they still INVADE countries.....this is a disgrace and the EU leaders have just handed Europe over and then they have gone quiet......it's shocking and unacceptable and needs sorting now not discussed next Wednesday as l've just heard.....they should be discussing this now on the W/end and resolve this major mess up!!!	1

"1. I don't worship a pedophile. I respect and adore a prophet. Placing him into the category of a pedophile is beyond pathetic as he lived 1400 YEARS. 1400 years. People change in 1400 years. In the future, people would call us pedophiles for marrying people at the age of 20-28. That's the problem that you don't seem to understand. It was a norm to marry women at a young age. How can I call someone who lived more than a thousand years ago a rapist if it was a normal thing for EVERY human on the planet at that point to marry young females? Marriage is also a choice in islam. I'm a young woman yet my parents don't force me to marry at a young age. THAT is culture. A culture that has ruined the true image of islam by mixing its own blend to make islam look ""nice"" for them. But it isn't. 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war). However, that doesn't mean that a man can just randomly go get a second wife just like that. He has to ask his first wife and if she agrees (nowadays a i doubt that), he has to go through his finances so he knows that he's able to take care of a second. I doubt even more that there will be a woman that would want to share their love for a husband with another which makes it harder for a man to find a second wife. If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. Also, nowehere in the quran does it state how many husbands a woman can have but yes it does say a man can have 4 wives. For women, it would mean that she could marry as many as she pleases (though WHY would a woman wanna do that? I don't wanna have more than one husband and I know for certain that we would enjoy putting our efforts and love for one guy and not many and men would not enjoy having to share their love for one woman but some regions in the world have different norms (which i'm TRYING TO POINT OUT because the prophet and those who lived with him existed in a different time with DIFFERENT norms). Today we have somewhat the same norms but because of differences in timeline, we change alot for the better but know that we can follow the same norms. It's just that it's very important to make everyone and God happy . 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war).

If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. 3. You want to know the positives that Islam has brought 30 YEARS FROM NOW? You weren't being clear with your point as you challenged me to state the positive things that Islam has brought to the west. I did but you are so reluctant to holding on to your opinion because 30 years ago, many ARABIC countries, not islamic, ARABIC countries decided to rebel against their leaders, resulting in new leaders and more rebellious groups are formed to overthrow the leaders. They use anything that is necessary to take down the leader and when they do, they have NO IDEA on how to govern at all. Are these muslims? Of course not. If strongly hold on to your actions and blame people when clearly there were better options (peace deals), then you're not a muslim. You're an idiot. Ignorant idiots. 4. The BIGGEST issue that I have with people criticizing isla m is that they point out issues with countries and how they govern. Both sides (the west AND ""muslim"" countries) are doing everything they can, knowingly and unknowingly sabbotaging the religion that once stated that through knowledge and peace, there will be victory. The problem isn't interely muslim countries, it's nationalism. It still exists and is the main reason why many have such hatred and rage towards others. even countries considered ""muslim"" have a grudge against each other (look at Saudi Arabia and Iran). Islam is a religion that unifies people, wether colour, race, sex, age or ethnicity. All it takes is an open mind and you might learn things beyond the screams and echoes from the media. I have watched Christianity and its history, I have seen the issues with Zionism vs Judaism, I have heard of people who believe in Buddhism but do terrible acts against others. WE humans are responsible for OUR actions and what we bring forth to our religion. Islam is always waiting for people to listen to it but many have always glared behind for other things and sometimes turned their cheeks. I CAN BRING a good image of Islam and I can also BRING a bad image of it aswell but Islam as a whole is never changed. It stays the same. Only I can become distorted or bad. THAT is why you see muslims bombing themselves and killing in the name of God: They are enraged, confused and don't know about Islam. When you live in a place where foreigners (US) have bombed, destroyed unity, taken their properties and placed terrible leaders there, what are the odds that you end up becoming confused of the situation, just like many, and do everything necessary to take back the good times. Suddenly you get it back but what CAN you do? You don't know how to govern, you know how to fight. All rebellious groups start out well, fighting for justice and then suddenly along the way, they become confused and even mad with power and strength that God has given them, only to use it to hurt others and blame God for that. There is a problem in these places but to solve it, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP BALING EVERYTHING ON ISLAM AND GET THEIR BUTTS OFF OF THESE PLACES and I'm talking mainly about the US. PS: My religion is MY choice but just like you have your choice, I wish to respect it and the same should go with you."	1

This is intolerable. Do not people realise that these people have been raised to believe that Jesus, though the virgin-born messiah, was not one-third of god?

This will clearly bring the end of civilisation as we know it. And what is more, some of these people are slightly browner than proper folk.	1

".. Uhm ""my country/citizenship/nationslity/identity"" is Canadian, not Greek. I'm glad you showed everyone how you think in labels and racist terms. For your information, I'm 3rd generation Canadian actually, and using a Greek name on Facebook is because I teach Greek and English and don't want students finding me easily on Facebook, and secondarily because of my ancestry which you were so eager to observe duh. The fact that you actually decided to publicly attack and deride Greeks for what their country is going through regarding their economy, just because you ASSumed I'm Greek (as though Greeks don't have a right to tell people what is objectively true or not just because, as you said their economy is in tatters), when in actuality we are talking about: a) refugees and Syrians fleeing their country into Turkey where they are safe from war and b) their illegal immigration into Greece and Europe, and c) whether the media should continue to label illegal immigrants as refugees, is utterly schizophrenic in your part my friend and proves exactly how terribly messed up your way of thinking really is. As for Greeks, since you mention, given the fact that about 10,000 have died due to the economic crisis, and over 200,000 have legally immigrated due to the economic downturn also, that's all the more reason not to compound the Greek problems and incapacity to offer help by burdening Greece with the largest number of illegal immigrants in Europe. I seriously doubt that American people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that French people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that Greeks are to blame for the mistakes and betrayal if their politicians and the stupid laws they pass and agreements they made and borrowed money they used. You are a dumb, ignorant bastard. I hope all the ""refugees"" come to your posh neighborhood in Austria. Then you will stfu. You are a bigoted racist. ==== Canada will accept mostly immigrants. The media, and morons like you, will keep calling them refugees because it's a sexier news headline. Enjoy Vienna built only in Greek style architecture. One of the most racist and Nazi cities in Europe, and the only country in Europe that has received the LEAST number of immigrants labeled refugees... It's easy for you to judge ask other countries.. I hope you are deported back to Britain by Austrian authorities so that your place is given to a Syrian family in need. They need it more than you do anyway, and have far more grounds to immigrate to Austria than you did, in your logic."	1
"Here's the full text: Article 31 - refugees unlawfully in the country of refugee ""The Contracting States shall not impose penalties on account of their illegal entry or presence on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorization, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence."	0
Brits don't know nothing about history isn't it? :p	0
Europeans who immigrated during WW2 weren't bringing Islam with them and their stupid demands to accommodate their medieval views. They weren't burning embassies and rioting when someone drew a picture of a pedophile prophet.	1

in syria there are 3 wars happening,the state is torned on many parts,there hundreds of local police over there and many teroristic organisations,not only al quaida or isil..isil is taking part on a specific way,capture your family and you have to start fighting for their goals,understand? it is so cruel war that you are on one side and your brother finds himself on the other side,not by own mistake	0
I agree 100%, Turkey is regarded as a safe country, along with the other countries that have been deemed safe and secure in search of Western Europe. Remember the scenes in Austria, Hungary and Croatia? The videos of food and water supplies being chucked onto the railways by adult males, rejecting hospitality. They were safe in Turkey and risked their lives all for what? By the time they get here they've lost family members, children, babies, and for what? Safety? Security? You had that. And you lost them because of your naivety to travel to Western Europe in search of the safety that you already had in Turkey, and other countries along the path.	1

"I wonder if it's possible for specific ""entrance"" points to be designated. The migrants would be properly sheltered at those points during which they would be ""processed"" (registered and given id and destination designation clarified) and then allowed to proceed to that destination. It would be a uniform process, accepted by all countries and clearly established as a uniform process for all migrants so they know if they cooperated in an orderly fashion they could be safe and enabled. This has nothing to do with the issue of quotas, just a concern for serving the best interest of people."	0
I was making a comparison about border crossing not terroristic acts! Next time think before you comment.The only exception is the Mexican didn't write it and by the way they were all Mexican across borders illegally into the United States they were from other Central American countries.	0
we had over 180 000 people passing through our country..... that is why I am saying you cannot really compare the 2 countries. For month we didn't let them through and tried to enforce EU law which means don't let them travel without papers. That is why we were called inhumane. The borders were only lifted because you cannot force people registering when they are already in the country and refuse to go to registration stations and refugee camps open for them.	0
I used to be pro-European. However, now, if there was a referendum today I would vote, OUT. I think that the EU is non-democratic and corrupt. Also it looks like this is the start of the end of the EU as we know it. EU II needs to have a President that is voted in by the citizens of the EU, and should not interfeer or have rights to control its states law and policies. Cameron for the first time in a while is making the right move. Either he should take us out of Europe now or be kicked out by the new fascist German leader Merkel.	1

Gordana I understand that y ou are angry, but we had this for months not days only..... and we have many unemployed and homeless too. Your president said that the economy and the tourism will be damaged. Really? Ours already has been damaged and we were expected to deal with this. We cannot force anybody to register but if they do want to they can the registration stations are still there. If they dont register they cannot enter the country. So you think Croatia is doing Hungary's job? Then dont talk about great European sprirt because you are contradicting yourself.... I hope that a commonn solution will be found and I am sad that this has not been taken more seriously before because it shouldn't have come to the point that people ony take it seriously when they experiencing it too....	0
It's clear enough to anyone that would read the comments on here - or even just try to understand my last comment. I will repeat - we have terrorists killing our citizens NOW - and we have terrorists in THIS COUNTRY plotting to kill our citizens NOW. We also have people recruiting muslims in this country to go and fight alongside ISIS right NOW. I have never said I hate Muslims - I hate terrorists, period. I hate extremists and fundamentalists that want to harm us, and our society, regardless of their race, religion, or ideology. You may have a right to be more concerned about your own citizens than immigrants - I do not know enough about US crime stats.. but that doesn't mean the situation is the same here. As I said, you wouldn't let me fly to LAX without passing security checks, so (in view of the ongoing threat we live with on a daily basis) why should we let anyone they want to walk in to Europe?	1

Delfina you mentioned Lebanon and Jordan. Most of the refugees that have gone there in the past year will be Syrian. 70% live below the poverty line. Also you point of refugees going to the other countries in Europe is not valid. Germany said that it will accept 800k. So why wouldn't you go to such a country who has the infrastructure to take you in and make use of your skills. Why would anyone stay in Hungary? have you seen how they have treated the refugees? Like animals. A couple of questions regarding Syrians being cowards that I hope you can answer: 1. Who are the Syrian people supposed to push out? Bashar/government? Al Qaeda? ISIS? or the hundred other rebel factions fighting? 2. Where are you supposed to get the money to buy the weapons? Did your grandparents find the weapons under their house or were they supplied by your government? 3. Would you keep your family under ISIS control while you are fighting? Would you take the risk that your child may be taken away at any moment or that an airstrike will come and kill the whole family? 4. Are all refugees leaving war cowards? Are Jews cowards for leaving Germany? 5. ISIS knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. 6. The government knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. You clearly have a problem with all muslims, be them children, women or trees because to you there is one type of muslim. They are all the same.	0

Dear Martina - they are migrants they moment they leave a safe country. True enough the ones that are in countries that border syria are refugees, but when you start marching across europe demanding entry into whichever country best suits your ambitions, you turn YOURSELF into an economic migrant. Could anyone actually give me a justification for continually arguing a point that has been explained to you time and time again? All these posts on here turn out the same way - the same trolls pushing the same message, yet never able to answer a simple question. Yes Egan and Andry, this directly applies to you. Given that the argument from them being called migrants is clear, what is the argument for them being called refugees when they leave a bordering country?	1

And their minds are less scientific, less methodical, less logical and less organised than our's, they can squabble and protest but at the first sign of major trouble they will be put down. They are not a major threat to us or our culture because we are stronger, smarter and vastly better equipped than they are. They either integrate or they fall through the cracks. Personally, I think the risks of rejecting them are far higher than accepting them. Accepted they are split up, put all over europe, in different communities, rejected they return together to their own countries blaming us for their problems.	1
Than they must stop the smuggling what they are constantly doing! If the countries where the illegal immigrants movements happen now, make physical barriers than they can't enter into the EU. Paralell the greek navy should stop the immigrants on the see and defend the Schengen border.

I'm not saying biologically Farhan, I'm saying culturally, they receive less education in Syria, there's less security, freedom of expression etc, Clock Boy was raised in America, he is ethnically Syrian, but he is culturally American. Hence I would consider him American. This isn't a race thing, I'm talking about these refugees, who, on average, are as I stated them to be, if they weren't their country wouldn't have collapsed. And if they were responsible they'd be reaping the benefits right now. They're fleeing poverty, war and dictatorial government, they're not a threat to us, all they bring is competition, which spurs the economy, innovation and a population boost, as long as the EU splits the load evenly these migrants/refugees will be a net gain for Europe, the way it's currently being managed though is that Germany will be overrun, fuelling tensions, spreading fear and causing problems, the burden needs to be shared for this to work.	1

Our fence won't save Europe, it only slows the migrants down a bit for other countries. It wasn't built to save everybody, it was built to save Hungary until or if at all Europe comes to it's senses so we can work on a solution to actually solves the problem. We pretty much pushed the problem to the romanians and croatians. First I felt bad for them but the only thing they were doing was criticizing Hungary. Croatia criticized Hungary for the way we deal with the crisis until the day of closing our borders. The next day they collapsed under the masses. Romania is luckier, noone goes that way so they can keep up the anti-Hungary propaganda.	0

I was wondering if this biased reporting may actually be arranged by the governments. Perhaps they want to be seen as compliant and humanitarian but actually fear a Muslim spread in Europe. Maybe they are afraid that if they don't help, Muslim countries will attack Europe. Or maybe they know we'll retaliate and argue that they are doing the wrong thing and that lawless people are not welcome so they will have democratic votes against what the UN is proposing. Just can't stand to think they could really be this stupid!	1

I read now news about refugees - Refugees officially entered - around 30 thousands till today, unofficially number is doubled! So... Our Prime Minister is with his unusual move forced a little neighboring states to open their borders. Now we have no more problems - everything goes smoothly because we have a transit country for refugees ... but the easiest way was to attack us that we are inadequate and that we did not hold out for two days - we did not, it is true, because any state around us did not stick to our agreement. I wish all the best to you Eszter and you family!	0
A refugee must ask for asylum in the first country where there is peace. If they continue to migrate to other countries, not having a valid travel document, crossing borders in fields rather than the official way, they become illegal migrants and according to laws should be treated that way and deported. Very simple. Tell me where there is war all the way from Turkey to Germany, Sweden, UK? You might say Kosovo, perhaps. Other than that there is no conflict and no reason not to ask for asylum. That being said - not only they are they illegal migrants but illegal economical migrants. Those who really need help of any kind are not these, but those who suffer in kemps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and even Egypt.	1
That's right Ryan, take the responsibilities for the war away from the west and blame those bad Arabs. Time for those countries, who for decades interfered with the middle east, to be held accountable and people like yourself to stop distorting the truth.	1

I look at all of these and become reflexive. This is probably the straw that will break the camel's back (no pun intended). Well orchestrated plan or whatever you think it is, the EU will crumble and without unity, there will be no more Europe as we know it. UK wants out and being positioned where they are, why linger?! Germany is a bully for the rest of the bunch. Eastern Europe has a different view on most of the EU's mandates. Spain, Italy and probably France wanted an out anyways. The peaceful, little ones like Holland, Belgium, Switzerland etc wouldn't matter. And that's how the cookie crumbles. The question remains: what's next?	0

The major thing I have learned from this'migrant-crisis' is that I now know where my vote will go in the forthcoming Referendum on the EU. I will vote to leave because, like many people here who won't admit it, the thought of the UK being in some 'club' with the Germans made many feel secure; the Germans, after-all, were the clever ones whose economy was up-and-away soon after WW2, while we lagged behind for many years. However, the way they have behaved over this crisis - handing out 'sweets' to migrants etc, is symbolic of their encouragement for the migrants to travel all that way; and absolutely ridiculous - and not a thought for their own people. It has now made my mind up, and I want to leave the EU	1
The crisis can be easily resolved. First Europe is not responsible for it, secon those from Syria should apply for political asylum and register and lastly send the rest back. It is so simple many of these people created their own crisis and put their families in danger.	1

When they took us as slaves didn't they mind that one day their children will invade to enjoy what their fore father's made... now the westerners are acting as if they are special organism...is a new world order and things must change upside down..or you should ask America..when a skin differentiates a fellow hunan being from another..why NOT BLOOD and transfusion of body organisms.. same as well, Europeans mid 18th century invaded weaker nations on earth..noe those nations are escalading to what they term as refugees ...real sense is modern slavery.. i hope Babylonian will fall one day so that they become humble as every race on earth	0

I am familiar with UN statistics. I was talking about make immigrants from countries other than Syria who traveled to Europe. Even Syrian refugees however broke the law when they refused to register in Hungary and demanded to go to Germany and Sweden, countries with the highest welfare. If you're escaping from a war torn country to be safe, then you're safe but you're very poor so you go to another country which is also not good enough so you travel through 9 more to get to the best one then you're not a refugee. Also that 64% of men are cowards, west should arm them and send them to fight isis just like our grandparents fought the nazis.	1

"Arbitrarily labeling them refugees and helping them illegally immigrate is as logical as allowing any person with tragic circumstances go through the USA south border and offering them assistance ""for the hardship they endured"" while they were trying to get there (which is what NGOs are doing in Greece, effectively being assistance to illegal immigration). They are in NO danger, perceived or otherwise, while they are in Turkey, a country to which they initially sought refuge, so what are they seeking refuge away from by suffering so much to get into Greece and Europe? So who is promoting all this? The media and NGOs are all in subversive collusion against the very idea of ""nation"", never mind ""state"". There have been numerous wars in the middle east before. Why is this mass surge of illegal immigration happening now and is also being justified by the media as necessary, for that matter ? No Palestinians, no Lebanese, no Egyptians, no Lybians fled en masse into Europe, but they have had war just the same in very recent years. Walking from Syria to Greece: 1600 km from Aleppo. Walking from Iraq to Greece: 1750 km from west Iraq. Where are all the Iraqi people?"	1
Yet each one of these countries implements religious laws, each is a backward hole where women are treated like cattle, Turkey is the most normal one because funnily enough is also the least religious. The only times when Islamic countries were advancing was when religion was pushed aside, such as during Sha in Iran.	1

Im confused if the migrants are escaping war in syria then surely as soon as they get to hungary and croatia then surely they have done this? Why then the need to travel to europe? Oh yeah the money and so called prospects. Ur hang on we cant feed and house the families and ex sevice men in our own countries how then can we find space and food for thousands of migrants??????

"So their story is tragic, indeed, but goes as follows: after war in their country they flee to the nearest safest place due to force majeure and seek refuge, for example in Turkey, where they also have an international legal status as refugees. Then, they don't like it there, for whatever reason, even though they are perfectly safe as refugees, and decide to illegally immigrate and walk or are driven by smugglers for 1700 km across Turkey's land to subsequently cross the sea into Greece, putting in danger their own and their children's lives by bringing more unnecessary treacherous hardship and toil unto themselves, utterly and wholly of their own accord. Meantime the media still calls them euphemistically ""refugees"" ad infinitum, long after they have chosen to do away with their legal status as refugees given that they immigrate illegally to other counties without being in any immediate danger, in fact even though they do not qualify as ""refugees"" in any sense of the word once they cross Turkey's border into Greece, neither in the legal sense under all international treaties, nor in the etymological sense; simply because for at least 1700-1900 km of land maybe way more and a stretch of rough sea with the help of an illegal smuggler whom they themselves paid, they illegally immigrate into a country two or ten borders seat from the one they had initially sought refuge into. So the small question is why are the media still all calling them refugees after they reach Greece, when CLEARLY BLATANTLY they are NOT in any sense of the word, legal or etymological or otherwise (compassion is not an excuse for bad journalism of forging skewed opinion shaping public perception). Are you saying that they are running away from dire danger while they are in Turkey, to which they initially sought refuge to, qualifying the use of the term as refugees due to force majeure into Greece? And the big question is: there are over 2.5 billion people with similar or more tragic circumstances. Should they be allowed to immigrate illegally to any country they please? What about Somalian children and people in general? They actually have it worse than Syrians in all respects, plus they don't make demands for halal food. Wanting their life back which was destroyed by war is understandable. But so do another 2.5 billion people around the world with similar or worse circumstances. Should they all be allowed to immigrate illegally into Europe just because the media arbitrarily label them as refugees long after they are no longer refugees nor, in veritable fact, seeking refuge into safety not running away from any danger, perceived or real?"	1
David, your response has left me bewildered due to the tone of immaturity and I believe you don't understand what I'm talking about. I meant the task of going to school. Education does change ideals, and like I said, it's what I have seen work. Like I also said, I don't have a solution. I'm just sharing what I've seen. My mom started out in a very religious, though not extreme, home. She was the first girl to go to school in her family. After going to school, her view became more modern. She broke off from the idea that women are only supposed to be serving men. I'm sorry if that's not the response you wanted. The current situation is a delicate one. Handle it the wrong way and you end up creating more extremists instead of diminishing their numbers. To answer your next question: I do believe all nations have a right to protect their citizens from any sort of threat. But how to deal with that threat is another issue. All in all.. Just because I am Muslim doesn't mean I am equiped to provide solutions for this situation or any similar situation . I can only tell you my experience. I can only say I don't want to see anyone get hurt. It's ignorant of me to say that but that's just how I feel.	0

Re Syrian Refugess why are these Muslim Rich Arab Countries not taking any? IE: Jordan. Saudi Arabia. Oman. Kuwait. Bahrain. Qatar. U.A.E. Strange don't you think?

Who allow their unruly Sons to Race around Londons Knightsbridge in hugely expensive Cars, and get their Rich Fathers to pay their Parking fines? Their Daughters who take over floors at Londons most expensive hotels and are guarded 24/7 by Private Detectives? All very strange. Muslim Countries rich or poor should help fellow Muslims!	1

Paula Robinson completely agree with you! Those of you who are really smart writing on facebook, come and see what is goning on on the hungarian borders. When they are throwing away tons of foods and water offered them and paid by OUR money. taking all fruits from our farmers yards like mantis. 85% of these poeple are NOT refugees! Refugees are and were always welcomed in Hungary. Rfugees are humble and thankful. They obey the law. I wonder how many of you seen that they used their kids as human shield whe the police hold them up. They THROW across the fence their own children for god's sake!	1
A Japanese bank calculated the cost to the German tax payer of ONE of these people over 12 months and it is in the region of €16,000! The kids are just tools to get benefits and without proper paper work and testing how can a family relationship be proven? The Romanians stopped large mobs of Bangladeshis on the Hungarian border.	1

2 million soldiers fought for the North, 750,000 fought for the South. The population of the US was 31.4mil. 6% fought for the North of 8% in total, so not all the American's 'fought'. Also when planes are dropping overhead, do you think you can just pick up arms and start fighting? You may have just gotten schooled by an Australian on your own history.	1

I have never called you stupid, but you very conveniently haven't addressed the points I have made. I have already pointed out many things that are bad about Islam: you almost worship a man who was a rapist and a pedophile, your book says that women can be raped if taken into slavery, your book allows a man to take 4 wives yet a woman isn't allowed 4 husbands, is she. Your religion requires total submission, shames women, doesn't allow them to make free choices. You haven't given me any positives about Islam, you have referred to very far past, again what has Islam brought to the west in last 30 years apart from misery, honour killings, bombings, rapes etc. Even Salman Rashdie had fatwa issued against him because he criticized Islam. I'm sorry but your religion doesn't merit respect because it's a religion. It's a choice and represents certain views and ideology and it will be subjected to judgment.	1

It is baffling why Indians who tried to kick out Brits from India for two centuries are stuck in Britain and feel great, full two million strong, have absolutely no self respect, shameful indeed	0
Yes, if you think in racial terms, the term 'we' to me means Britons, individuals born in Britain, which include a wide variety of ethnicities, who receive a British education and are raise around British culture, and so have developed better critical thinking skills and understanding of the world than their average Syrian counterpart, so although I would not consider these refugee/migrants ever British, their children could be, as opposed to sending them home where their children will be born into deprivation and conflict, and so more likely to become the next generation of militants. I may very likely be termed a cultural supremacist, but I am not racist at all, I think interbreeding is the best way to assure positive trajectory, mongrelisation assures greater vigour and superior genetics, as can be demonstrated in all animals.	1

"no one is attacking ""refugees"" for being refugees when they truly are refugees nor attacking ""immigrants"" for being immigrants when they truly are legal immigrants. The attack is on the media who sensationalize the news using terms such as ""refugees"" in a frivolous half thinking manner, or so it seems."	1
Maria Szpunar the reason were talking about Muslims at all really is that they have just forced their way half way up Europe against any international law , they come from war torn areas, we have seen them fighting in the streets with police and rioting , we have seen the Islamic flag flown in Germany again when the Syrian Migrants were fighting with German police, we have seen them fighting in the streets of Europe against the afgans a culture clash there , this is in the space of a week, what your seeing is an invasion of Europe nothing less, by who? Refugees, no to be a refugee you have to stop at the first safe country and seek asylum that would have been Greece or Italy.if you proceed you are a migrant and if you have not got papers , passports or any id you are an illegal migrant, however as Ty Royce Weldon says they are the single greatest threat that the western world have 9/11 to remind you in your country, brits killed on a beach in Tunsia recently bombings and be headings, As you say there is bad in each culture very true but this lot rank in top place for total disregard to life did I mention the use of chemical weapons , If this were America I am sure the Americans would want to vet these people before taking them into their country, but in fact they are better to remain in their own cultural land and should really be taken in by other Mislim countries and not be given out handouts and maps to the promised land they already have it its called Syria and as we see all these pictures of a males forcing their way up Europe like a riot mob when ever stopped and asked for ID , they should be fighting for their home land to forge a future for their families , a great majority of these peope need sending back to a safe area and if refugee? go through the right international procedures .but this is just plain lawlessness.	1
I'm not sure how Islam is going to take over when they're more lilkely to be secularised than we are to be islamised, our military is stronger, our economies are stronger, our culture is stronger in most every way.

The EU has no real plan for this crisis, what annoys me the most is if someone is a genuine refugee they would seek asylum in the first EU Union country and that's Greece. Sure most have an idea in mind to get to Germany as the 'ideal' country to settle in, unfortunately this can be interpreted as an 'economic refugee/migrant'. We need to ask, what's really going on.	1

@ Delfina Jones, three things: 1. Extreme Ethnocentrism to the point of disregarding others' opinions and putting yours at highest 2. Insulting people's opinions to raise your own to prove you're right 3. The Islam faith is one like Christianity where Christianity dominates a lot of Europe and the western Countries in which Christianity went through destruction and death to get where it is today (referencing back to religious laws back then in European history, the Crusades, colonization and teaching the beliefs of Christianity using it for manipulation, etc). The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully). Many are dying yes, and modernization has let those extremists cause a lot more damage globally however, what must be kept in mind is that there are some who do need help. Ignoring a problem won't make it go away. Yes, countries like yours have internal issues to solve but without the world, globalization from countries other than yours, the country you currently live in wouldn't have developed into the way it is today. Which is most likely pretty modernized. Congratulations, you won the lottery ticket of privilege. Unfortunately others didn't. And you most likely won, as well as many of us, from immigration from the origin of our countries. The reason of immigration may be different for all of us but it's certain that we moved for the reason of a better life. If your family was denied to immigrate, you could've been in the Syrian's shoes or your descendants would have faced more issues while your origin county developed possibly ending your family line, meaning you wouldn't have been born. Try stepping into others' shoes and keep an open mind. Thank you	0

The EU had better form a large military alliance and go into the Middle East and help end the problems so the people don't have a reason to live.

Ekama Noieau you don't need weapons.... Minds are the most powerful and destructive weapons ever created. Europe will be receiving over a million refugees that do not have any clue what we are, just thinking that we are responsible for their loses.	1
I think what Esin meant was that eduction is the key to fighting religious extremism and it's true. That's why Europe needs to stop allowing for so much religious freedom including religious schools etc. Schools need to be secular ,no headscarves in schools, teach Muslim kids since they are little that it's ok to be gay, that women are equal to men etc. This is by the way the least we can do on top of stopping immigration from Muslim countries. I am pro EU but I'd advocate for abolishing of the schengen zone after what Merkel has done.	1

It's about time we saw the whole story, The latest reporting has been nothing less than a media campaign to make us feel sorry for a mob heading our way.

Do you really think we are stupid. Go on any website most people don't want any of them here. We have enough of our own problems. We do not want to become a Muslim country, Mrs Merkal says she wants them then let her have them all. Then close our borders .	1
why ther is no refugees in the arab countries.especially the GULF countries.?	1
You disgusting individual! I pity you and your ignorance and stupidity!	1
Russia’s increased activity along the Syrian-Turkish border signifies the closing phases of the Syrian conflict. With Syrian and Kurdish forces holding the border east of the Euphrates, the Afrin-Jarabulus corridor is the only remaining conduit for supplies bound for terrorists in Syria to pass…..When this corridor is closed and supplies cut off, ISIS, Nusra, and all associated NATO-backed factions will atrophy and die as the Syrian military restores order across the country… With that support being cut off and the prospect of these militants being eradicated, the true sponsors behind this conflict are moving more directly and overtly to salvage their failed conspiracy against the Syrian state. What we see emerging is what was suspected and even obvious all along – a proxy war started by, and fought for Western hegemonic ambitions in the region, intentionally feeding the forces of extremism, not fighting them http://off-guardian.org/2015/12/19/why-the-west-can-never-defeat-or-forgive-russia/	1

"2. Though islam is a religion that shows similar patterns to judaism and Christianity, the religion was giving in clear message that 1. it came in peace:The worshippers of the All-Merciful are they who tread gently upon the earth, and when the ignorant address them, they reply, “Peace!” ""Quran: 25:63 and: And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say: “To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we do not seek out the ignorant. Quran: 28:55 (the first letters to ever come from quran, sent to humanity was ""READ!"" = KNOWLEDGE) 2. it was finalizing what came from the previous religions but also adding alot of details that will make it almost IMPOSSIBLE to be corrupted (memorizing by all muslims, scientific facts, stories from the past, more laws and the way it's written is just not HUMAN. It's so precise)."	0

you mean like the Christians could have done the same in there own country but didn't ?? You mean the Christians that did to the natives you cry muslims want to do to you ??

My dear iri since you are German you should know about the economic situation in Greece...the government can't provide the basic for its own citizens, what could they do for the huge flow of immigrants? ..just visit a Greek hospital or just make a quick search in Internet and count the number of Greek volunteer teams helping other citizens...for the refugees it seems that what happens in our islands and mainland is something we have to deal with while the rest of Europeans can comment on Facebook.. That's sad no?	0
After the damage to its European and international image during the Greek financial crisis negotiations debacle Angel Merkel is 'jumping the gun' and opening the gates to 'floods of people' looking for government hand-outs who have no (or little) hope of finding work in Germany or are prepared (or able) to integrate themselves into European society .... Hungary should be commended for showing people that its laws must be respected and that it is absurd to claim to be a 'refugee' and simultaneuosly 'force' (battling police, even if unarmed) your way into another country ... the real refugees from the Syrian civil war are in the refugee camps of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey and deserve all the help necessary to provide them with the basic necessities of life and a chance to immigrate to another country by LEGAL immigration or return to their own country once the fighting has stopped and international assistance in rebuilding that country should be generously provided ... not least by the countries who took advantage of Syria's domestic problems (to reduce pressure on Israel to make peace with the Palestinians) and by their meddling (sending mercenaries) prolonged the fighting and caused many civilian deaths and most of the refugee problem ...	1
BBC just stop lying in general about these countries and the crisis! I'm getting really fed up with this one-sided disgusting propaganda! I know it's not strictly a response to this video, but please let me say this. These people (I'm perfectly aware that not all of them, but most) are very agressive, when they don't get what they want. They demonstrated it very well at the Hungarian-Serbian border two days ago. BBC always shows crying children. But the fact is they're crying, because they are used in order to get sympathy and when they get tossed around they just get scared of the yelling and agression. They're crying because the migrants' actions make them cry. Not the Hungarians, Croatians or Serbians, The migrants always use babies or little children as shields. How can they do this to those poor kids? And they're called 'refugees' by BBC...yeah some refugees these are.... There are leaders among them who tell the crowd what to do via megaphones. Yeah obviously when you're fleeing from danger you must carry megaphones with you in your backpacks...yeah right. And the fact that BBC is assisting this Trojan horse move is outrageous!	1
It is not about being Muslim or not. It is about humanity. Don't be racist just only sit in front of the computer only.	1
Far too many. After getting what they want, will they want their families to join them? Why aren't they asking for refuge in a Muslim country! Frightening. Britain has its own problems - where are we going to put thousands more?	1

Instead of letting all these refugees in, why don't we (all european nations, NATO ect) send a lot of troops in to eradicate ISIS. Surely in the long term this is the best possible solution. The one time we have a genuine humanitarian reason to get troops on the ground and because there is no financial benefit no one is interested, we just prat about with our toy drones and a few bomb drops slowly picking them off and its not working!!!	1
Islam is not a race. I don't care about peoples sexuality, nationality or race, but religion is a choice. Being a moderate Muslim is like being a moderate nazi or moderate kkk member.

lol - you not been watching the news then? Germany shut their border when they couldn't cope!! Hungary have arrested at least one confirmed terrorist on their border. People are moving freely across borders and disappearing. And I ask again, what are you doing as a person, or a country, to help? Can you not see that the current situation is being used to rid you of any responsibility? If the refugees were in camps in Turkey etc, the UN would call on you to help... if they are artificially dispersed the UN can avoid a crisis, and the US can wash it's hands.	1

As usual the BBC is at it again ... Plugging their agenda ....	1
"Put aside economy and what ours politicians talking, every country has that problem... We all know that this kind of refugees travel throught the countries just like that... even german chancellor knows that.... I'm or we are not contradicting - You forgot Eszter that before you close border there were agreement that Croatia will be transit country ( are we?) and that you all the time untill you close yor border WERE TRANSIT, no one around you made a problem to you for refugees because we heard all kind of news from Hungary, good and bad, register and not register - but, I repeat - you were transit all the time. Croatia is not in the same situation - we are surounded with countries who close border and not allow refugee crossing... EU just can't expect of us to do job what we all had to do from the beginning and we can't accumulate refugees in Croatia because suddenly all of you find out that is a bit too much of them. I'm contradicting? Europe is thought to cheat Croatia again and turn Croatia into a ""collection center for refugees"" - because what else will mean close all borders around us and suddenly the EU rule - no new corridors? You forgot - Hungary had open coridor during the long period before closing border!!!! I have a right not to be contradicting because I'm not - I have the righ to be very angry. Solution for a problem is - all states can open border and one rute can go through Hungary, one through Croatia... or we all can help Greece to close land and sea borders or.... there is many solution but no will. Eszter... Hungary as a country is a great, I really have nothing against you and I just even admire border act you done but this just not right toward Croatia.... We are also knows read and listen when foreign politicians or common people talk and we know add up 2+2... Closed border around us, EU rule - no new refugee coridor... we must be stupid enough to not figured out what that all mean! And after all that what I wrote now, I still respect you country and you and one day maybe we can drink coffee somewhere... but do you all respect my country?"	1
Anyone remember WW2?	0
Personally, I think CIA agents triggered the civil war in Syria. America wants to weaken Assad and by that weaken Russia as well, since Russia supports Assad. Russia needs that harbour which he rents from Assad. So they're 'friends' if you will. America's only interested in the oil there and weakening Russia. Furthermore if there's any kind of war, then America can sell weapons as well and it's a huge business. But I agree with you on that the superpowers should've left the Middle East alone!	0
